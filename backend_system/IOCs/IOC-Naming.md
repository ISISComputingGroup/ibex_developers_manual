An example IOC name is `HAMEG8123`, to which a suffix like `_01`, `_02` is automatically appended. New IOC names should be max 8 characters long (excluding the `_01` suffix) and be in uppercase letters. The same name (with the same casing) should be used also for the top-level IOC directory under `EPICS\ioc\master`.
