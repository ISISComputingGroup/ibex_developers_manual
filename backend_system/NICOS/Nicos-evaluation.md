# General NICOS notes
NICOS uses a bespoke protocol across a TCP connection for communication between client and server. Scripts are sent to the server as pure python which are run on the server in a dedicated scripting thread.
 
There are a number of functionalities which are in NICOS but are not mentioned in this design document. Some of which may be useful to an ISIS scripting system but some may need to be removed/disabled.

- **Setups** - These appear very similar to the concept of configurations under IBEX. They give information on what devices are available and code to be run on instrument start-up. This will most likely be surpassed by configurations in IBEX.

- **Devices** - Comparable to IOCs in IBEX. NICOS has many different types for different devices, as well as some ‘System’ devices such as Experiment and Instrument which provide info on the current experiment and instrument. This will most likely be surpassed by IOCs in IBEX.

- **Server Modes** - NICOS provides a system for managing script permissions. There is one master that is allowed instrument control, a slave which is allowed to view and a maintenance account which is allowed to override control from master. A simulation account is also used for dry runs. 

- **Async Commands** - Code can also be asynchronously executed in the currently running script namespace (but outside of the script thread). This gives the ability to quickly change the instrument state on the fly but also brings up the potential for threads fighting for control. 

== Opinions ==

=== Required NICOS Modifications ===

In contrast to other systems NICOS is very simple in the way it expects scripts to be inputted as it only requires pure python.  This means that there would be very little work required to start using the system. The following would need to be done at a minimum to get the system working:

- Get the NICOS server running as part of an instrument build

- Get the NICOS console client  working as part of an IBEX build (not necessarily integrated into the IBEX app)

- Add genie python commands to the available command list

=== Further Modifications ===
- **Removal of unnecessary features** – Many of NICOS’ features are already implemented differently in our control system and will need to be removed or disabled within NICOS. This may prove difficult depending on how tightly coupled features are to the system, more analysis is required.

- **Provide a programmatic interface for creating ‘server-aware’ commands** – There are commands within NICOS that allow more server control (such as the sleep command that allows pausing midway and reports on how long left to sleep) and a wrapper that does some error checking on commands. However, this may need to be expanded to make it easier for breakpoints and return information to be added to new commands. This could be done with a python object that new commands inherit from? To more accurately allow the server to simulate commands they will also need to be ‘server-aware’

- **Make Genie Python ‘Server Aware’** – For genie python commands to be able to pause mid-command and to send information such as command progress they will need to be rewritten and incorporated into NICOS.

- **GUI** – The NICOS GUI, although good, is written in PyQT and cannot easily be integrated into IBEX. A plugin will have to be written to allow NICOS access. The Scan Server client could be a candidate for this interface but would require large amounts of modification as it is written to provide xml data to the server and not generic python, it would be easier to write a client from scratch. It could be possible to use a PyDev console to connect to NICOS as a start for this but a more graphical interface will be required in the future.

- **Available Commands** - Although the list of commands can be gathered from the server by sending a specific python command this would not be easily parsed by a client to show available commands. This is not an issue for users that are comfortable in using a python command line but will be useful for any simple-to-use ‘Script Builder’ client. To do this a new TCP command will need to be created which provides available commands in a more machine friendly format (e.g. xml). Another option would be to extend the already available ListCommands() method but this would be more complex as it would require to send some Python calls and parse the result before being able to display available commands to the user.

- **Provide more script feedback** – Feedback from the current script is limited  to the script’s contents, what line is currently running and a string describing the current action. Additional information such as % progress and estimated run time should be included.

- **Provide better management of job queue** – Currently the user has the ability to delete items from the queue. This could be expanded to allow copying and moving in the queue.

- **Additional script validation** – Scripts can be validated by users by performing a ‘dry run’, which will also give estimates of how long the script will take. However, there is no guarantee that a user has performed this check before running a script properly.
