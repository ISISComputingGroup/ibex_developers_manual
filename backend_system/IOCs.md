# Before Creating an IOC #

Remember, EPICS is a collaboration! Why create an IOC when you can just use one that's already out there? If the device is not ISIS specific, before thinking about creating an IOC check whether it is listed [here](https://epics.anl.gov/modules/manufacturer.php) and, if not, email the mailing list [here](https://epics.anl.gov/tech-talk/index.php).


# Creating an IOC #

Building a new IOC? Before you get started, take a look at the relevant [instrument page](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/wiki) to see if there's any useful information for the device you're about to write an IOC for. Otherwise, let's get going. If you have problems see [See IOC and device Troubleshooting](IOC-And-Device-Trouble-Shooting).

There are two sorts of IOCs, EPICs and pycaspy. For EPICs type see the automatic creation below for pycaspy see the [pycaspy ioc](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/ibex_developers_manual/wiki/ioc-pcaspy).


## Automatically
If you're building a new StreamDevice IOC you can use the [IOC Generator script](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX_device_generator), for developer info see the [wiki](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/ibex_developers_manual/wiki/IOC-Generator).

## Manually
If you're not creating a StreamDevice IOC or you you would like to know how an IOC could be created manually see:
* [Creating an ISIS StreamDevice IOC](Creating-an-ISIS-StreamDevice-IOC)
* [Creating an LvDCOM IOC](Creating-IOC-wrapper-VI)
* [Creating a simple IOC](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/ibex_developers_manual/wiki/EPICS-basics#creating-a-simple-ioc) - usual basic way to make an IOC on new EPICS installation, not the way we do it in ISIS.

## Fleshing out the IOC
1. You can now flesh out your IOC to work. I would encourage you to do this in a TDD style (if not write the tests afterwards) and make sure you follow the [conventions](IOCs#conventions). To write in a TDD style use:
    * [IOC Testing framework](IOC-Testing-Framework)
    * [Emulating devices](Emulating-Devices)

    If you used the script to create your IOC an empty emulator and IOC tests will have been created for you.

1. [Record simulation](Record-Simulation)

1. [IOC Finishing Touches](IOC-Finishing-Touches)
    * Additional for motors:
        1. [Adding motor IOC to global motor moving and stop all](Adding-motor-IOC-to-global-motor-moving-and-stop-all)
        1. [Add support for motor extras, e.g. axes](Add-support-for-motor-extras)    

1. [Running (and testing) IOC](Running-IOCs)

1. Add any manuals used to the [manuals directory](Manuals)

1. Add a page about the device in the correct categories in [Specific Device IOC](Specific-Device-IOC)

1. [Create an OPI](OPI-Creation) and send it to instrument scientists for approval.

# Debugging IOCs

Debug builds of IOCs are built in jenkins and can be deployed to instruments, see [here](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/ibex_developers_manual/wiki/Deploying-a-DEBUG-build-IOC).

It can be useful to add a msgBox to pause so you can attach a debugger, see [here](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/ibex_developers_manual/wiki/IOC-Utilities#pausing-an-ioc-at-startup) for instructions. To attach the debugger start the IOC, open visual studio with the code in you wish to debug, set breakpoints as you wish and in the top toolbar select "Debug >> Attach to process" find your process in the list and attach. You can control the debugger as you would other debuggers using the buttons on a toolbar just below the toolbar you clicked on with "Debug" in it.
