This section of the wiki contains information about how to create and maintain IOCs. It is the ammalgamation of information from the old Trac documentation and the new GitHub wiki. It is in quite some need of refactoring and rearranging. Hopefully I will get to it soon, if not, please consider making some positive changes yourself!
