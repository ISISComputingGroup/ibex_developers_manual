# Items from last retrospective
- More context and pictures in ticket headers, screenshots in release notes
  - ES pointed to two things: 
1. In certain cases the ticket is otherwise well written but the requirement has changed.
2. [6053](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/issues/6053) is a good example of a well written ticket.

- Flash reviews as task
  - LJ ==> Important that these aren't ignored and picked up due urgency. On the task board if there are no updates we generally overlook the board. However with flash reviews on the board, no update could mean important reviews haven't been taken up. We need to be careful when checking the task board.
 
# Items from the current retrospective

## Splitting PM duties
- KB to split duties with GR

## Make sure flash reviews don;t get missed
- track on github, flash reviews column on task board
- checking the teams channel on Monday is good, but there's a chance tickets get buried

## Finding out tickets aren't needed
- this has happened in the past, we try our best, sometimes we are given incorrect information
- When picking up a ticket, verify with scientists what exactly they want for it (add this to the dev wiki)
  - Alternatively contact relevant sample environment team

## standup length
- keep it to fewer points
- keep engaged during checking of tests/instrument health

## github actions
- might be useful instead of jenkins builds
- spin up a windows environment for us
- started looking into a few, can be difficult
- where it's easy, try it, run it in parallel with existing builds, turn of the jenkins versions when no longer needed
- wiki check might be easy enough to move
  - Friday ticket to do this
  - KB already trying to move project board checks
- not sure if we can have project level actions
  - actions are repo level, org level we'd need an app, however we can make our own (KB already trying this)

## Mad sad glad
- LJ Friday went well, had both meetings, interesting tickets, completed in time
- SC glad he tried programming elsewhere in EPICS
  - Some OPI standards were difficult to find, in fact most hidden in checker script
  - we don't have a standards page, but we do have an example template OPI we should use
  - perhaps make a Friday ticket to make the checker script more clearer
- ZK glad about description of the ticket that didn't end up being needed
- ZK glad SC bringing new tools into the meeting
  - happy to try it, but many of us unsure about its used
