Training machines have there own deployment script. It is similar but not the same as the usual instrument upgrade/deployment. It removes all previous traces of IBEX on the system and then installs it as if it was a clean machine. It also installs some training material and a training config.

Steps:

1. Make sure that the install script has been pulled it is in `...isis experimental controls public share\ibex_utils`
1. Open a command line inside the `installation_and_upgrade` folder
1. Run `training_update.bat`
1. Follow the steps until the end
