We have two books which should serve as a reasonable introduction to the Eclipse RCP platform: 'Eclipse Rich Client Platform' by McAffer, Lemieux and Aniszczyk, and 'Eclipse 4 Application Development' by Vogel. Most of the contents of the latter book can be found on the Vogella website along with a large number of additional Eclipse RCP and JFace tutorials.

### E4 and compatibility views (e.g. `org.eclipse.ui.console`)

Although we run an E4 product, we are able to load E3-style plugins via the eclipse compatibility layer. However, any UI element referred to via the compatibility layer must be defined as a shared element in the client E4XMI, not defined in a snippet as this does not work correctly with certain UI actions - for example, resetting layouts.
