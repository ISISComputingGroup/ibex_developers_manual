Common Eclipse Issues
=====================

Sometimes the error messages that Eclipse gives are a little opaque, so here are some possible solutions for some of the more common issues.

The type XXXXXXX cannot be resolved. It is indirectly referenced from required .class files
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Possible solutions:

* Delete the complaining plugin from the workspace and then re-import it.
* Remove JRE System Library from the complaining plug-in's Java Build Path then re-add it.

Product XXXXXXXXXXX.product could not be found
----------------------------------------------

Typically is followed by a lot of errors relating to bundle resolution, for example:

.. code::

    !MESSAGE Product uk.ac.stfc.isis.ibex.product.product could not be found.

From this example it seems to be related to uk.ac.stfc.isis.ibex.ui.statusbar as that appears multiple times.

Possible solution:

* Check the offending plug-in has been added to one of the feature projects as a plug-in

New plugin is not available (and possibly crashing existing plugins)
--------------------------------------------------------------------

This might be difficult to find as an error, and it may not exist for other developers - even on the same branch!
Adding the plugin directly to your configuration solves this.

I really cannot work out why the GUI won't start!
-------------------------------------------------

Starting the GUI via Eclipse just doesn't seem to work and I cannot see why!

One useful thing to try is to use the run configuration to check all the correct plug-ins are included:

* Right-click on ibex.product in uk.ac.stfc.isis.ibex.client.product and select Run As->Run Configurations...
* Select ibex.product under Eclipse Application
* From the tabs select "Plug-ins" and click the "Validate Plug-ins" button
* If it displays errors because plug-ins are missing:

    * Close the dialogs and add the missing plug-ins to the feature.xml file in uk.ac.stfc.isis.ibex.feature.base or one of the features
    * Repeat this whole process again from the beginning
    
* If there are no errors then click the "Run" button to see if it works

If this does not work then good luck!
