# Introduction
OPIs live in `ibex_gui\base\uk.ac.stfc.isis.ibex.opis\resources`

 - Start CS-Studio to create/edit an OPI (see `EPICS\CSS\master\start_css.bat`)
 - Load in the project in `ibex_gui\base\uk.ac.stfc.isis.ibex.opis\resources`: File -> Import -> General -> Existing Projects into Workspace.

 - Set the correct path for the Fonts and Colours files: Edit -> Preferences -> CSS Applications -> Display -> BOY. For the colour file choose `/resources/Share/isis_colours.def`; for the font file choose `/resources/Share/isis_fonts.def`.

 - Create a new OPI with File -> New -> BOY -> OPI File
 - Change to the "OPI Editor" perspective to allow easier editing.
 - You need to use "OPI Editor" to edit your files, **not** "Display Editor". The later creates a display builder file and not an OPI.
 - Edit the OPI - note that the `template.opi` will give you an idea of the style to use. It is best to copy controls from this template to keep the same behaviour.
 - Also add an entry to the `opi_info.xml` file which can be found in `resources\opi_info.xml`. Note that some Macros are provided (See below).

If you are stuck on how to do something with an OPI there are a number of in-built examples, which you can view by going to File -> Import -> BOY-> BOY Examples.

## OPI Editor vs Display editor
When editing an existing OPI or creating a new one, it is important to use OPI editor over Display editor, as the display editor is not currently compatible with the rest of IBEX. If you have opened an OPI and can't find the ISIS colour and font schemes, this possibly indicates that you are using the wrong toolset. You may also find that the file extension is being changed to a .bob file when the file is saved in a Display editor window.

Re-opening the file in an OPI editor window (right click OPI -> Open With -> OPI Editor) may solve these issues.

## Consistency - Template OPI
In order to promote consistency in look and feel between different OPIs, we have created a template OPI in `ibex_gui\base\uk.ac.stfc.isis.ibex.opis\resources\template.opi`. Please follow the guidelines provided in this template, including ALL fonts and colours (it's probably easier to just copy the widgets from this template). If you're adding new widgets in your OPI which are not covered by this template, please add them to the template.

Please also make sure your OPI works well for colour blind users, following [these guidelines](Designing-for-Colour-Blindness).

If you are converting an existing OPI from the old to the new style, be aware of [these tips and gotchas](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/ibex_developers_manual/wiki/Converting-OPI-to-New-Style-Tips-and-Gotchas).

There is a script called `check_opi_format.py` in `C:\Instrument\Dev\ibex_gui\base\uk.ac.stfc.isis.ibex.opis` that can help you check certain aspects of a new OPI. This script does not replace checking the OPI visually, but should help catch some style errors in OPIs. This will iterate over all OPIs in the `C:\Instrument\Dev\ibex_gui\base\uk.ac.stfc.isis.ibex.opis\resources` directory, and write logs to the `C:\Instrument\Dev\ibex_gui\base\uk.ac.stfc.isis.ibex.opis\check_OPI_format_logs` directory by default. Other behaviours are described below:

Usage:
`python check_opi_format.py [-h] [-file FILE] [-directory DIRECTORY] [-logs_directory LOGS_DIRECTORY]`

e.g. 
`python check_opi_format.py -directory resources/Lakeshore336 -file Lakeshore336.opi -logs_directory my_logs_directory`
will scan a single OPI in `resources/Lakeshore336/Lakeshore336.opi` and save the logs in `/my_logs_directory/`

## Macros
When an OPI is opened from the synoptic (via OpiTargetView.java) you get at least the following macros automatically set:

- `NAME`: the OPI title, as defined by the synoptic component editor (e.g. "Slit 2"). When setting up the OPI this acro should be in the Name property of the OPI.
- `OPINAME`: name of the OPI file opened (e.g. Slit.opi)
- `P`: the instrument pv prefix (e.g. IN:LARMOR:)
Others macros may also be available, passed down from higher screens (also defined via the synoptic editor component)

One convention we have used is to define a macro within the opened OPI called PV_ROOT which we then use to make full PV names. So at the top of the OPI XML would be something like

    <macros>
      <include_parent_macros>true</include_parent_macros>
      <PV_ROOT>$(P)$(EUROTHERM)</PV_ROOT>
    </macros>

here EUROTHERM would be a parameter passed from the synoptic and it is combined with P to create the prefix for all PVs referenced within the OPI screen. The macro name should be something like the un-shortened device name, and its value would typically be the IOC name used in the PVs, e.g. EUROTHERM_01.

In case an OPI's PV_root is defined in its parent, you need to go where to the parent OPI, select the section that represents the child OPI, and in the Macros row in the Properties tab you can find the value for PV_ROOT. Example: The psu_summary_indicate_changeover OPI can be found in the parent OPI riken_front_end_overview . If you open the former in OPI Editor, PV_ROOT ca not be found in the Macros row. However, if you go to riken_front_end_overview, which is the parent OPI, and click a linking container that links to psu_summary_indicate_changeover, you will find that PV_ROOT is defined in the Macros row.

### Other Standard Macro Names

| Name | Meaning |
| ---- | ------- |
| PV_ROOT | Root for all PVs within an OPI |

# Completing the OPI

Add the IOC name with appropriate information, including macros to the xml file

  ibex_gui\base\uk.ac.stfc.isis.ibex.opis\resources\opi_info.xml

In the xml file:
* `key`: unique name for component
* `value.type`: the component type, same as name of constant in ComponentType (uk.ac.stfc.isis.ibex.synoptic.model)
    This enables the correct component target details to be added when component details are selected
* `value.path`: the path to the opi file (relative to the resources folder)
* `value.description`: description which is shown in target details
* `value.macros.macro.name`: name of macro in OPI
* `value.macro.macro.description`: description of macro value which appears in target details when user clicks on the macro. For a macro that contains the IOC name please provide an example with the actual IOC name in brackets.
* `value.macros.macro.default`: default macro value.  This will be placed into the appropriate cell of the macro table if one isn't already present.

Please follow [these guidelines](Synoptic-Icons) when specifying and creating new synoptic icons for the OPI.

The final step should be to send the OPI to the instrument scientists. If they don't approve it that is fine but it is good to get their response.
  
# Testing

To start and interact with a testing IOC see [Running (and testing) IOC](Running-IOCs)
The easiest way to test this is to run IBEX-gui through the eclipse editor. Create a device screen and use this to test. The device screen can be refreshed (right click -> refresh) to display the latest changes made in CSS editor.

# Debugging: No scrollbars

Check if you have stray widgets. An example of a stray widget might have:

```
<x>-2147483647</x>
<y>2147483496</y>
```

If you have a stray widget, it may prevent scrollbars from appearing on your OPI. It might be possible to solve the issue by selecting and copying the elements to a new OPI. You can then diff the old version and the copied version using the following tools:
- XML sorter
- Diff tool e.g. notepad++, winmerge

# Writing to char waveform PVs and displaying char waveforms as strings

CSS text input fields can write to char waveform PVs but needs to be set up in a special way. If you don't do this, the `NORD` field of the waveform will not be set correctly on write and the PV value will only be written successfully if NORD already has a large enough value.
- Postfix the PV name with ` {"longString":true}` (note the space before the JSON). The final value in "PV Name" should look similar to the following: `$(PV_ROOT):ARBITRARY:SP {"longString":true}`
- Ensure "Format Type" is "String"

# Data browser Graph Creation

To make a databrowser graph on an OPI:

1. In CSS go to the data browser perspective
1. Click button "Add new databrowser plot" which is graph with a plus on in the tool bar
1. Right click -> Add a PV/PVs
1. PV should start with `$(PV_ROOT)` and end in `.VAL`, e.g. `$(PV_ROOT)POS.VAL`
1. Alter colours, remove/add title and legend, rename axis
1. Save in the resources folder, probably in a subfolder for the device (extension will be added automatically as .plt)
1. Add a `Data Browser` monitor to your opi
1. In properties in file set the file you have created

# Activate tab

If it's required to activate a tab from a synoptic via a macro: (See SKF G5 Chopper OPI as an example.)

1. Put macro in local PV
1. Create script that reads value
1. Set active tab on tab container using `setActiveTabIndex`

# Create a Local Enum

AS OF 05/02/2020 DOES NOT WORK.

Create a local pv in an opi with labels (From Tech talk article not tested).

    loc://demo<VEnum>(2, "A", "B", "C", "D")

If you cannot use an actual enum PV because there are too many labels, and you can't use a local enum PV because that doesn't allow changes to the enum labels, then don't use an enum PV. Instead, on the combo box, un-check the option to get "Items from PV" and directly enter the items, as many as you want.
Or set the items from a script:
```
    from org.csstudio.display.builder.runtime.script import ScriptUtil
    combo = ScriptUtil.findWidgetByName(widget, "Name Of My Combo")
    combo.setItems( [ "Ene", "Mene", "Muh" ] )
```

# Enable and disable controls

If the enablement state of a widget (i.e. `enabled` property) is controlled as part of OPI logic, it can be made more obvious by also controlling its `transparent` property.

See `\base\uk.ac.stfc.isis.ibex.opis\resources\mercuryiTC\enablement_of_controls.py` for examples of setting properties based on the value of a PV.

Initial investigations centred on alternating the background colour of the control between e.g. `ISIS_Textbox_Readonly_Background` and `ISIS_Textbox_Background`.  However, although the logic and syntax were sound, the OPI didn't faithfully reproduce the requested colours.

# Using OPI rules and external scripts

When implementing display logic for OPIs (such as toggling an objects visibility based on a PV value) our standards are: 
1. Rules take preference over scripts for trivial logic
1. Scripts if needed should be an external file

Bear in mind that both scripts and rules run **in the GUI thread** this can lead to unresponsiveness if you are doing a lot of work in them. You can write multithreaded scripts, see the jaws_display.opi for an example of this.
