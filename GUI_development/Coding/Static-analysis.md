We are currently making use of 3 static analysis tools to help ensure the quality of our code: [PMD](https://pmd.github.io/), [FindBugs](http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/), and [CheckStyle](https://checkstyle.sourceforge.io/). These particular tools are mostly intended for use with Java programs and as such our main use for them is the Eclipse GUI project, though they are also used on some Java code in the main EPICS project (specifically the IOC log server).

All of these tools have maven plugins which allow the analyses to be run as part of the maven build process, with the results being output to an XML file. Additionally, they all have Jenkins plugins which can consume the XML results files, producing reports and graphs within Jenkins and allowing you to track code quality trends over time. The Jenkins reports list all the specific violations which can be categorised in a number of ways and are listed with file name and line number as well as a detailed description of the problem.

# Checkstyle

Checkstyle is designed to enforce a set of highly configurable coding standards. It supports a very large number of rules including ones relating to naming conventions, annotations, javadoc comments, poor coding practices, etc. That rules that Checkstyle will check for violations of may be configured in an XML file. 

The style rules imposed by Checkstyle are very demanding and it may be helpful to consider them as guidelines rather than as hard rules. At our first analysis of the Eclipse GUI project, Checkstyle showed over 30000 errors and it probably isn't worth the effort to fix all of these. However moving forward, when writing new code, it is a good idea to make at least some effort to conform to the Checkstyle 'rules'.

Checkstyle configuration is done by XML file called 'checkstyle.xml' which is located in the tycho parent directory. This is then set up as a global rule set called IBEX Checks. The rule set used is the default Sun ruleset with some rules disabled (by commenting them out in the XML file). In order to reduce the number of needless Checkstyle warnings, the following specific rules, which are enabled by default, have been disabled for Jenkins:

* FileTabCharacterCheck - using a tab character anywhere in the code
* RegexpSinglelineCheck - line has trailing white space
* LineLengthCheck - more than 80 characters in a line
* JavaDoc - checks for JavaDoc comments
* LineLength - checks that lines are not longer than 80 chars
* AvoidInlineConditionals - checks for ? : style conditionals
* HiddenField - checks that method parameter names do not mirror class parameter names
* InnerAssignment - checks that inner assignment is not used
* DesignForExtension - enforces a programming style where superclasses provide empty "hooks" that can be implemented by subclasses.
* FinalParameters - checks for method parameters that should be declared "final"
* NewlineAtEndOfFile - checks for a newline at the end of the code file
* MagicNumber - checks for numbers that could perhaps be variables instead

The ISIS standard Checkstyle rules for the IDE is stored in the repository for our client, so that can just be imported rather than setting the rules up by hand. For the Eclipse IDE the "MagicNumber" rule is not disabled as it does occasionally provide some useful warnings, but can be ignored for cases where it is being pernickety.

An example of a "useful" warning:

    @Override
    public int hashCode() {
        return displayName.hashCode() ^ (isWritable ? 1231 : 1237);    // It is not clear what these numbers represent
    }


An example of an overzealous warning:

    @Override
    public String getColumnText(Object element, int columnIndex) {
	IocState ioc = (IocState) element;
	switch (columnIndex) {
	    case 0:
	        //The hidden column
	    case 1:			
	        //The IOC Name column
	        return ioc.getName();
	    case 2:			
	        //The IOC Name column
	        return ioc.getDescription();
	    case 3:                                                    // MagicNumber flags this up
	        //The current state column
	        //This is handled in getColumnImage
	    case 4:                                                    // MagicNumber flags this up too
	        // Dummy column that is hidden by the scrollbar
	        return "";
	    default:
	        return "Unknown column";
	}
    }

There is also the option of using the `@SuppressWarnings` qualifier to tell Checkstyle to ignore certain warnings for specific classes or methods. For example:

    @SuppressWarnings("checkstyle:magicnumber")
    public void getSecondsInHours(int hours) {
        return hours * 60 * 60;    // Magic numbers!
    }

Or for multiple warnings:


    @SuppressWarnings({"checkstyle:magicnumber", "checkstyle:localvariablename"})
    public void getSecondsInHours(int hours) {
        int seconds_per_hour = 60 * 60;    // Magic numbers and a variable name that does not conform to the recommended style!
        return hours * seconds_per_hour;
    }

# PMD

PMD focuses on potential coding problems such as unused or suboptimal code, code size and complexity, and good coding practices. Some typical rules include "Empty If Statement", "Broken Null Check", "Avoid Deeply Nested If Statements", "Switch Statements Should Have Defaults", etc. PMD will produce far fewer warnings/errors than checkstyle, however they are typically far more important, indicating technical problems with the code rather than merely stylistic ones, and should therefore be fixed whenever possible/sensible.

# FindBugs

FindBugs detects similar types of problems as PMD, though it can detect many additional serious problems such as potential null pointer exceptions, infinite loops, and unintentional access of the internal state of an object (to name a few). Unlike PMD, which checks through the source code, FindBugs actually checks through the applications bytecode for potential issues. FindBugs tends to find a smaller number of more important issues.

For both PMD and FindBugs, there are certain rules which, while generally sensible, may not apply to the project at hand. For example, on the Eclipse GUI project, FindBugs throws up a lot of problems involving writing to a static member from an instance method, however the Activator class in most Eclipse plugins make use of this construct.

# Maven

The tools may be run as part of a maven build by including them as plugins in the project's pom.xml. In the case of the Eclipse GUI, each plugin is included in the 'tycho.parent' pom.xml file, and is therefore used in every other project (Eclipse plugin) during the build.
