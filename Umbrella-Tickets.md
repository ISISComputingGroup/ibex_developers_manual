Umbrella tickets (or Epics in agile speak) are over arching tickets which contain multiple stages. Sometime you may feel it is beneficial for you or the reviewer to split a ticket which has been agreed in backlog prep into multiple smaller tickets; in this case you create an umbrella ticket.

## Case 1 Before working on an original ticket it is clear it should be split

* Create a smaller ticket it should be named <TICKET NUMBER>-1: <Ticket purpose>
* Estimate the ticket
* Assign the ticket to yourself
* Reference the ticket in the original ticket and reduce its estimate by the estimate of this ticket. If this makes the ticket negative by more than 1 then talk about it with a member of the team.
* Work on the ticket as if it were a normal ticket
* Inform Kevin that you have created an umbrella ticket so he can track the new tickets (this may not be necessary)

## Case 2 After working on a ticket for a while you want to spin out a new ticket

* Create the umbrella ticket with the original estimate of the ticket minus the estimate of the present ticket. If this makes the ticket negative by more than 1 then talk about it with a member of the team.
* Name this ticket the same as the original
* Rename the original tickets as <TICKET NUMBER>-1: <Ticket purpose>
* Set the estimate on the original ticket
* Spin out any new tickets as in case 1
* Inform Kevin that you have created an umbrella ticket so he can track the new tickets
