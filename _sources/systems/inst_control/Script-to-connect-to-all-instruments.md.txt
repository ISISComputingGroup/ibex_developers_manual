This is in the private repository on the shares. To use it clone as normal but use the path to the repo instead.

This is a script for general use change it as needed. Currently the following functions are implemented by putting the right functions in the main of the script.

Implement functions:

- can be used to get versions of all instruments
- can be used to list usage of genie functions
- can be used to update files on drive
