# Minimum machine specifications
The following are the currently agreed minimum specifications for hosts that the group maintains or provides advice on the procurement of. To ease support, the minimum number of groups of hardware possible were chosen. 

## Equipment specific PCs and setup machines 
_e.g. NDXWish_Setup, NDHHIFI-CRYOMAG_
These have been grouped together as their requirements are broadly similar and having the same spec makes support easier. 

- small form factor
-  64 GB (2 x32GB)
-  dual 1 TB SSD TLC in a RAID configuration


## NDC hosts
These are intended to be able to host a client and run remote desktop/VNC connections. A lower spec has been chosen than other hosts (rather than simplifying support by having one spec) in order to keep the price down for science groups and encourage them to purchase these over their own choice of boxes. 

- small form factor
- 32GB (1x32GB) Memory
- single 512 GB SSD

## NDH hosts
Still to be agreed, the above spec for equipment support PCs likely represents a floor for this specification, but a higher spec may be required. 

## Notes
These were last agreed at a [series of meetings ](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/ControlsWork/issues/805#issuecomment-3201337769) in the summer of 2025. These specifications were based on a 6-year lifetime from the
date of the meeting (i.e. machines bought with the above specifications are expected to become obsolete in 2031).
