# Modifying code on an instrument

What to do when you need to fix something on an Instrument or modify code on the instrument.

1. Fix the bug
1. Record the bug as a ticket; with solution done
1. Note the bug next to the instrument on the main IBEX page
1. If the bug is likely to effect other instruments inform the team using the group email
    1. If it will seriously effect instruments an email can be sent round offering/organising time to fix it to all scientists 
    1. If it is minor it can be sent to those who are interested
    1. If it is unlikely to effect anyone then it can be noted in known bugs section of the release notes
1. If the bug will seriously effect instrument scientists consult the PM

The reasoning behind this procedure is so we always know what is on any instrument but don't have to create a new release to fix something. Part of the release process is to delete any changes to an instrument and then put back any noted changed. So if the changes aren't recorded then they will be lost.
