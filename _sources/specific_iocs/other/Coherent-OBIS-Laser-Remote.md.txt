# Coherent OBIS Laser Remote

The Coherent OBIS Laser Remote is a small box which connects to a single laser and provides status and fault information via LEDs on the front panel.  Much more information is provided via the remote interface.

**NB** This device does not allow the laser itself to be controlled remotely due to safety regulations (a physical key is required).  It simply reports its current state, that of the laser, its controller and enclosure interlocks.
