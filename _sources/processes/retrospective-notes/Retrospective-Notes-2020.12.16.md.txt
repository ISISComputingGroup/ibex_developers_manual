## Items from the retrospective before last
### Supporter of the week
- If on-call keep an eye on the emails etc
- It's good that people are keeping an eye on it, just need to remember to add the note
- The being on-call/supporter of the week wiki was highlighted
- The wiki page needs updating, including which teams channels to watch over and checking up on pending tasks that are due that day
- DO volunteered to update the notes with some aspects
- CMS will have a look sometime about any other tasks

## Items from the last retrospective
### Email template
- Still needs to be done, DO will look at this
### POLARIS Sample Changer
- POLARIS was happy, but transferring to SANDALS meant that the system was not easy to use there, partly due to balancing the needs of different instruments, and partly due to the present working situation
### Support channel
- Helpful, but probably need to keep an eye on patterns/trends. However, the developers are usually pretty good at keeping an eye on those
- Useful for the quick issues but which still allows knowledge to be shared

## Items from this retrospective
### Drop-in sessions and the shared/private email discussion
- Ways to fix the response options are listed, and the wiki has been updated with appropriate instructions
- Training and similar should follow the same pattern
### Release notes
- Lots in the dev notes that were not moved into the release notes, and there may be some that are missing from the dev notes as well
- There are tickets in the backlog that cover this, these will be proposed for the “Friday” sprint
- Review should have an entry in the Dev release notes, review complete needs to be added to the scientist visible release notes
### Presence on site not enough if there are multiple tasks at once
- Considering more people on-site to allow for meetings and support, and deal with multiple items
- Remind the other teams that advance warning of things moving that may need help to set up advance warning helps us to make sure that we can provide an appropriate level of support

## Additional Comments
- Did very well with the tickets, we should be happy with the graph
- Board is relatively clear
- Tickets in progress or in review get completed, tickets in ready and the bucket will be considered for inclusion in the Friday sprint, any not added will be reprioritised as standard in January
