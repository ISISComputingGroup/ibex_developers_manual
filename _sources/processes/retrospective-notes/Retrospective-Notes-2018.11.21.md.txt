# 2018-11-21

Short sprint with too many tickets made it weird; make sure next sprint is reasonable.

- Good to install before machine physics; everyone agreed.

- 2nd console issue should at least document [I have added to user manual). There is a ticket to discuss larger issue

- We should link from places in the GUI to the user guide on at least all views. Ticket created #3814.

- Migrating instruments vs improving gui/ fixing bugs
    - We are happy we are making deadlines for migrations but it is a push
    - Make sure that we prioritize IOCs better within an instrument, what should be done now vs later
    - LVDCom vs EPICS IOC usually epics is better we have not been back to any ones we said we would quickly do and come back to!

- How much to push the Script server?
    - push it, it is the way forward
    - should provide training
    - mention in upcoming demos (there is a list of advantages)
    - [X] Dom to create a template of questions to ask at Instrument scientist demos

- Simulation mode
    - look at Adam's scan simulation library
    - integrate into NICOS
    - make it easier to use

- Future Ideas
    - Ask Kevin how it works
    - Review it a couple of times a year
    - this page needs updating

- Script migrations
    - Should be done more with scientists so they own the script. Change wording on the migration page [done]

- Move sprint end to after Christmas [done]

- Maintenance View
    - We should worry more about long-term maintenance of the project now we are delivering it to multiple machines. We have some tickets "in flight" and we should make sure we don't deprioritise them because it is important for the future.

- Bunch of tickets:
