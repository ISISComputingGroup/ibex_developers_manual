# Periodic git pop-up while client is running

If Nicos is not correctly up-to-date and working it has been seen that periodically a git.exe cmd pops up on screen. This has an associated console error:
```
*2020-02-26 14:31:01.578 [Worker-9: NICOSConnection] INFO  uk.ac.stfc.isis.ibex.nicos.comms.ZMQWrapper - Opening ZMQ connection to NICOS

```
Nicos is (most likely) spawning a shell which in turn creates a git instance but fails to start the full server. To remedy this, first console into the NICOS server: `console -M localhost` and `Ctrl-T` + `Ctrl-X` to stop auto-restart and kill the process. Then re-install NICOS using: 
```
%python3% -m pip install --upgrade --extra-index-url https://forge.frm2.tum.de/simple nicos-pyctl
``` 
Once it has installed successfully you can `Ctrl-T` + `Ctrl-X`, once more in the NICOS console session to re-enable auto-restart and restart the server. You should then see the client connect to the NICOS server successfully:
```
