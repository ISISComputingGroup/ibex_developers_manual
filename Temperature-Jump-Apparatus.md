# Temperature Jump Apparatus

The device has been designed and built in house.

There are two temperature blocks, which are set to a temperature using a standard controller. The cell is pressed against one, a length of time is allowed to pass to set the temperature, the block in contact with the cell is then swapped for the other block, which will be at a different temperature.

### Communication
