Manual system tests should be performed as part of the release cycle and should be performed once a branch has been created.

If a bug is discovered:

1. Create a ticket
1. Decide on how important/easy to fix this bug is
    1. If it is can be fixed for this cycle append the label "for current release"
    1. If it can not be fixed then add this bug to the release notes under Known Bugs

Attached is a spreadsheet for the system tests.
