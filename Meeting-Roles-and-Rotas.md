It was decided that we would set up a rota for the various roles in IBEX meetings, a rota is below. There is only a single rota for each type of role, although not all roles are needed at all meetings, there is a column then to indicate where in the rota we are. If the person scheduled on the rota isn't available, then a volunteer will be asked for at the beginning of the meeting and we will continue the rota next time. If you are scheduled for more than one role choose which one you do this time, and you get to do the other one next time. At the moment this should cover for 6 months, and it is not a repeating pattern, and it is subject to change.

# Role descriptions:
## Chair 
* Needed for Pre-Planning, Review/Retrospective, and Planning
* Make sure things happen as per the ticket workflow details for meetings, see the [processes](Processes) page for more details (if they are out of date, update them)
* Keep the meetings on track (as much as possible)

## Timekeeper:
* Needed for Pre-Planning, Review/Retrospective, and Planning
* In Pre-Planning and planning limit discussion of tickets to a maximum of 5 minutes per ticket
* In Pre-Planning and planning, act as moderator for the voting site, reopening voting as approprite (please announce when you do so to avoid everyone refreshing constantly thinking their site is bugged)
* In Review ensure there is enough time for everyone to speak in the hour - this would be an average of 5 minutes per person if everyone was planning to demo
* Keep an eye on the end time of the meeting - give everyone a five minute warning
* If the meeting is scheduled for more than an hour to indicate the halfway time to make sure we take a break

## Note taker in Retrospective:
* Keep notes of the discussed points
* Add them to the wiki with a link on the [main retrospective notes page](Retrospective-Notes)

## Note taker in Planning:
* Make notes on tickets of any important information which gets discussed but is not already mentioned on the ticket
* Add a timestamp to tickets of when in the recording the ticket was discussed.

## Stand up:
* This is a weekly role starting on the first working day in that week, with substitutes being decided daily if the named person is unavailable last minute - if you know you are unavailable for the week swap with someone
* Load and share the web pages as detailed in the tabbed note in the announce channel in the team
* Ensure everyone present has their chance to share progress, plans, and obstacles
* If you're able to, writing a squish test to replace one of the [Manual system tests](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/ibex_developers_manual/wiki/Manual-System-Tests) would be great. If the person running the week before has done so and it hasn't been reviewed, now would be a good time to review that as well.
