We have two books which should serve as a reasonable introduction to the Eclipse RCP platform: 'Eclipse Rich Client Platform' by McAffer, Lemieux and Aniszczyk, and 'Eclipse 4 Application Development' by Vogel. Most of the contents of the latter book can be found on the Vogella website along with a large number of additional Eclipse RCP and JFace tutorials.

Note that the most recent version of Eclipse RCP is v4, however we are using v3 for our control system software.
