# Specifications

The 1050 was designed to provide exceptionally precise and reliable solvent delivery for a wide range of HPLC applications. The pump can be fitted with either a 10 or 50 ml/min pump heads that will be RFID recognised for auto set-up. Depending on the head used there are maximum flow rates, pressures and accuracies:

|                        | 10 ml/min                                 | 50 ml/min                               |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| Flow rate range        | 0.001 to 9.000                            | 0.01 to 50.00 ml/min                    |
| Max. delivery pressure | 400 bar (40 MPa, 5 800 psi) < 10 ml/min   | 200 bar (20 MPa, 2 900 psi) < 25 ml/min |
|                        |                                           | 150 bar (15 MPa, 2 200 psi) < 50 ml/min |
| Flow rate accuracy     | deviation ≤ 1 %                           | deviation ≤ 1 %                         |
| Flow rate precision    | RSD ≤ 0.1 %                               | RSD ≤ 0.3 %                             |
