### DAE switches from processing to Unknown and never goes into SetUp

See [Other Troubleshooting -> instrument page not working on web dashboard](Other-Troubleshooting#instrument-page-not-working-on-web-dashboard)

Also once observed on LARMOR, accompanied by the following error messages continuously being logged to `C:\data\log\icp-<date>.log`:

```

```

This was resolved by powercycling the DAE followed by stopping the visa server and running `resman`. (Ask Freddy or Gareth to find out more)

### No log files are produced in `c:\data` even though blocks are set to log.
The reason may be because cp hasn't been set to look for epics. In `C:\LabVIEW Modules\dae\isisicp.properties` set `isisicp.epicsdb.use = true` to log the epic's blocks. You will need to restart the `isisicp` process for this to take effect. To do this, just end the `isisicp` process in task manager.

### DAE doesn't seem to be connected/I want to run without a DAE connected
The DAE can be set to run in simulation mode, this must be unset before data will be collected. To set the mode run `g.set_dae_simulation_mode(True)` or `g.set_dae_simulation_mode(False)` to unset.

To change the simulation mode manually, in `icp_config.xml` change the simulate property to 1 (or 0 if turning off simulation mode). `icp_config.xml` can be found in either the "LabVIEW modules" or "ICP Binaries" directory. Stop the DAE IOC from the console, then kill the ISISICP process. Finally, restart the DAE IOC from the console.

### Log file for labview modules DA

The log file for real icpisis program is written to `C:\Data\Export only\logs\icp\log\icp-<date>log` and should read something like:

### Error pop up: `*** ICP failed to start - your DAE may be switched OFF or is missing cards ***`
The DAE unit may be switched off. This is particularly likely during shut down. Change the DAE into simulation mode as described above.

If the DAE is on then it is likely that it has been power cycled.
Two possible ways to fix it are:
 
1) Restarting the DAE rack server
 
1) Via NI MAX, using the following steps:
    a) Connect to the DAE rack server via Remote Desktop from the NDX machine (the machine should be listed in the Remote Desktop dialog)
    b) Run NI MAX on the DAE rack server
    c) Under Software->NI-VISA X.X.X,  select VISA Server and click "Stop server now"
    d) Under "Devices and Interfaces", select "VXI System" and click "Run the VXI Resources Manager.
    e) Finally, repeat b) but click "Start server now"

### Blocks not being added to Nexus file
This should not occur but has when a database was missing our extra column in the archive. If the sample table in the archive is missing a sample_id, run the following. Note that it can take a while on a database with a large number of rows in that table.
``` "c:\programs files\wherever...\Mysql.exe" -u root -p  --execute="ALTER TABLE sample ADD COLUMN sample_id BIGINT UNSIGNED NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT COMMENT 'Sample id'" archive```

### Not enough CRPT memory

CRPT (Current Run Parameter Table) memory is a large in-memory structure used to store information about the run, including histogrammed data. Data is read from the DAE into CRPT memory and then written to file, in event mode CRPT memory is where events are histogrammed on the fly during collecting to provide real-time spectra. If you get a CRPT size error, it means the product of (number of periods) * (number of spectra) * (number of time channels) is too big. If you are in histogram mode you either need to reduce one of these variables or get the CRPT size increased (icp_config.xml) but remember this is real memory that the ICP will claim at startup. If you are in event mode and get a CRPT error, it may mean you have misconfigured the time regime you plan to use for the on-the-fly rebinning e.g. you are trying to rebin events at event mode resolution not at a coarser resolution. The event mode / histogram mode choice and which time regime to use is governed by the wiring tables.

### End of run script not working

See https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/ibex_developers_manual/wiki/Experimental-Runs#experimental-files-not-being-archived-and-so-not-appearing-in-the-journal

### No frames/beam current registered by the DAE

Try switching the timing source to "Internal test clock" and starting a run. If counts are received in this state, it means that the DAE isn't receiving timing pulses from the central source. If that's the case, it needs attention from the electronics group (e.g. Simon Moorby).  Note, this may occur on more than one beam line so keep an ear open for any other reports.

Don't forget to switch the timing source back when you're done!

Other things to to check in this state are:

- [ ] Visit the beamline - (possibly with electronics is suspecting a hardware problem).
   Software usually doesn't just stop normally when other things are working  - right? :smile: 
- [ ] Most importantly, ask the scientists if anything happened around the time of the problem, in a recent case they mentioned someone had moved a cable on an ADC (although this was not the problem!).
- [ ] Look at the lights on the ADC or detector input module cards on the DAE. If no lights flickering, there is no data coming in and this is a good indicator that the HT might be off (a few lights might mean shutter closed or beam off).
- [ ] data/transfer lights on a DAEII, flickering & transfer lights inactive not a good sign.  Could be the link to the PC if transfer lights are not showing activity.
- [ ] If frame/raw counts are not showing up, a good diagnostic is to put the DAE into "Internal Test Clock".  If this works and frames appear, it is likely that there may be a problem with a Time of Flight signal (this often affects more than one beamline.

The issue here is that the default simulated DAE has 2 detector cards in it, but the real DAE has more cards. To fix edit `isisicp.properties` in Labview modules to create more cards. Note this is not an ibex issue - it will also affect DAE simulation mode under SECI. The number of cards on each crate is given by the maximum missing card for the crate (see log), more crates can be added as well as cards. An example from wish with 3 crates, 10, 10 and 12 card per crate is:

```
isisicp.simulation.detcards.crate0.number = 10
isisicp.simulation.detcards.crate1.number = 10
isisicp.simulation.detcards.crate2.number = 12
```

If you have defined `isisisp.datadae.use = true` in `isisicp.properties` then you need to make sure the detector card referred to in data_dae.xml  is created by above. If this is a pure setup/test machine rather than a real instrument, you may just want to set `isisisp.datadae.use = false`

### DAE exception messages

If you get an error in you IOC log like:

```
[2018-10-26 17:33:37] sevr=major Win32StructuredException code 0xc0000005 pExpCode 0xc0000005 pExpAddress 0000000000000000
[2018-10-26 17:33:37] 2018/10/26 17:33:36.741 IN:DEMO:DAE:AD1:INTG:TMIN:SP devAsynFloat64 pPvt->result.status=3, process error isisdaeDriver:writeFloat64: status=0, function=184, name=INTG_TMIN, value=0.000000, error=Win32StructuredException code 0xc0000005 pExpCode 0xc0000005 pExpAddr
```
 
One cause would be the IOC is trying to call a function in the ISISICP that it can't find. If the ISISICP has been updated, but   /RegServer  has not been run, then new functions added there will not be visible.

### DAE3 does not start 

DAE3 is new ethernet based acquisition electronics on ZOOM and MARI, it used `ISISICP` and looks like DAE2 for most purposes. If everything remains in processing, it may be that the `arp` network entries did not get created - these should be done as a system time boot task. Do `arp -a` and see if there is an entry for 192.168.1.101 etc.  If not, run `set_dae3_arp.bat` in `c:\labview modules\dae` as as administrator

### Error code 112

If there is an error code 112 reported in the log it means that the disk (data volume) is full and it can not start the `isisicp` program.

### DAE Type mismatch error

If you get an error from ISISICP `*** ISISICP STARTUP FAILED (DAE type mistmatch)***` it means you are running `isisicp` program with the wrong sort of dae ie 2 when you have 3. You need to source the correct version of the code for your type of DAE.

### isisicp.exe keeps allocating 4GB of memory and then releasing it

It may be https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/issues/3701 - you just need to change the archive array table type to MEDIUMBLOB.  Due to a bug in the C++/MySQL connector, each time the database is read, a LONGBLOB's worth of memory (4GB) is allocated and then released.  By changing to MEDIUMBLOB (16MB), a much smaller amount is used.

In `C:\Instrument\Apps\MySQL\bin>`, run `mysql.exe -u root -p` and enter the MySQL root password when prompted.

Then run these commands to modify the DB in place:

```
USE archive;
ALTER TABLE sample MODIFY COLUMN array_val MEDIUMBLOB;
```

### Instrument stuck in `WAITING` state

We have observed on a couple of occasions that the DAE got stuck in `WAITING` despite no blocks being outside of runcontrol limits. The cause is yet unclear but in the meantime a restart of the `RUNCTRL_01` IOC seems to fix the issue.

### ISISDAE reports `time regimes 1 and 2 are incompatible`

Time regimes are incompatible when their starts differ by a non-integer number of microseconds, but sometimes rounding errors may lead to this happening in other circumstances. This check is actually no longer required and has been removed in ISISICP SVN revisions 2010 and above. 

### ISISICP writes a corrupted journal file

The symptom is that `C:\data\journal_<cycle_number>.xml` will not be valid xml, it will be truncated at some point. We believe this happens when there are too many blocks set to log into the journal in a particular configuration.

After switching back to a configuration with fewer blocks, the journal file can be (carefully!) manually edited to remove the corrupt entry. Once this is done, runs should go back into the journal as normal (however, runs done while in the configuration with too many blocks will be lost from the journal).

Freddie may also have a patched version of the isisicp that fixes this issue.

### My blocks aren't being written to a run title properly
