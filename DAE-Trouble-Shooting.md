### No log files are produced in `c:\data` even though blocks are set to log.
The reason may be because cp hasn't been set to look for epics. In `C:\LabVIEW Modules\dae\isisicp.properties` set `isisicp.epicsdb.use = true` to log the epic's blocks

### DAE doesn't seem to be conected/I want to run without a DAE connected
The DAE can be set to run in simulation mode, this must be unset before data will be collected. To set the mode edit the xml file in `C:\LabVIEW Modules\dae\icp_config.xml` set the simulate property to 1 to simulate 0 to use hardware.

### Log file for labview modules DA

The log file for real icpisis program is written to `C:\Data\Export only\logs\icp\log\icp-<date>log` and should read something like:

### Error pop up: `*** ICP failed to start - your DAE may be switched OFF or is missing cards ***`
The DAE unit may be switched off. This is particularly likely during shut down. Change the DAE into simulation mode as described above.
