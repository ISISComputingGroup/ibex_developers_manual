<h2>Purpose of this guide<a class="headerlink" href="#purpose-of-this-guide" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>This description of the process is aimed to help improve communication, rather than be followed with no consideration as to what is needed for the members of the group to flourish, please edit it as required.</p>

<section id="title">
<h3>Title<a class="headerlink" href="#title" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This should be a succinct representation of the content of the ticket.
Where there is a logical grouping of themes, using a <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">Keyword:</span> <span class="pre">Title</span></code> format can make it easier to find related tickets without having to create umbrella tickets</p>
</section>
<section id="user-story">
<h3>User Story<a class="headerlink" href="#user-story" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This is <em>why</em> the work needs to be done, and for <em>whom</em>.
It will be centred around an actor who is part of the process, whether that is a user, developer, someone providing support, someone with a role will have a need and the story should highlight who has that need.
It should state what needs to happen, along with the justification of why it needs to work that way.</p>
<p>As a role/method of interacting with the system, I want it to behave in this way, so that something does/doesn’t happen.</p>
<p>This should amount to a requirement, one or two lines at most.</p>
</section>
<section id="acceptance-criteria">
<h3>Acceptance Criteria<a class="headerlink" href="#acceptance-criteria" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This is how we define <strong>done</strong>, so this is <em>the outcome</em> or <em>what</em> we need to achieve. Reading this set of checkboxes it should be easy for a developer or a reviewer to be able to say “yes it does that”. These need to be clear. There should also be as few of this as is practical to match the user story.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="notes">
<h2>Notes<a class="headerlink" href="#notes" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>This is a good place to provide extra context, who to talk to, what might impact this work and similar. This is extra information</p>
<section id="design-details">
<h3>Design/Details<a class="headerlink" href="#design-details" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>This is an aspect that is usually not included, but may be of benefit to people with less experience and knowledge of the codebase and ways of working within a team.
It is described as not included as some developers do provide this level of detail at times. (e.g. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/issues/1208">https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/issues/1208</a> gave great detail of the changes that were needed for that work). As has happened in some places, comments can be added to detail more of the technical specification, including command sets, UI designs, and so on.
Because these can be more proscriptive than just an acceptance criteria (this would be <em>how</em> to do it, not just describing when it is done) care should be taken as to when this section is included so that it does not stifle creativity or limit the approach to be taken. However, it can make the difference between being able to look at something and undertake it with confidence, or not, as well.</p>

<h3>How it maps to the purposes of each section<a class="headerlink" href="#how-it-maps-to-the-purposes-of-each-section" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>Title: If you know what you are doing it is enough to meet the acceptance criteria
User Story: This clarifies who, and why, it’s someone attending the meeting, and they want to have something drink with them
Acceptance Criteria: This is clear, there is either a cup of coffee or there isn’t, Schrödinger’s Coffee is not an experiment worth conducting in this scenario.
Notes: Some extra context and information
Design/Detail: This is not at so low a level that there is no room for creativity, and it assumes some knowledge that should be straightforward enough for the majority of people. But, it does specify enough that someone who has never done this before has at least a good chance of succeeding when combined with the notes as that specified which cupboard.</p>

<section id="when-to-add-design-details">
<h2>When to add Design/Details<a class="headerlink" href="#when-to-add-design-details" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>This will vary based on the task and scenario.
Sometimes that design/detail will be in other documents, and they could be referenced, especially for new items where interfaces have probably been discussed in greater detail.
If there are new team members this can be a benefit to them, as it breaks apart the system/architecture design side from the developer side.
If there are no other clear requirements anywhere, such as with some of the reverse engineering that has been undertaken in the past. That way the ticket has the history, but the wiki can stay rooted in the present.
It could be added before the ticket is considered at all by the team, but it might also be something to add after prioritisation in certain situations.</p>
