<h2>Creation of Tickets<a class="headerlink" href="#creation-of-tickets" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Tickets should be created at need by developers as git issues using the IBEX Project Board. Initially, they should <em>not</em> have a milestone attached to them unless they are needed for a definite date and this is the LATEST that they could possibly be started. If you are doing this ensure that there is enough time for testing; bugs fixing etc. If the ticket is created for a scientist don’t forget to note this in the ticket.</p>
<p>When creating a ticked put on appropriate labels. When adding a ‘Proposal’ label, also add the ticket to the ‘Planning’ project in ‘Proposals’ column.</p>
</section>
<section id="movement-of-tickets">
<h2>Movement of Tickets<a class="headerlink" href="#movement-of-tickets" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Developers should pick up a ticket as close to the top of the Ready column as they can (i.e. don’t pick a ticket assigned to someone else).</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Assign the ticket to yourself and move it to in progress.</p></li>
<li><p>When the ticket is done.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Create a pull request. If the pull request is in a public repository the PR size bot will automatically assign a label to it based on the number of lines changed. For details see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/noqcks/pull-request-size#sizing">https://github.com/noqcks/pull-request-size#sizing</a> . Note that these labels are purely informational for other developers and do not form part of the sprint process (in particular, they are not related to ticket sizes in any way).</p></li>
<li><p>If the config needs updating either:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Add a change to the config updating script (usually if it affects multiple config/instruments)</p></li>
<li><p>Add a step to the upgrade script (usually when it is a simple change which affects a single instrument)</p></li>
<li><p>Go onto the instrument and add the change (be <em>very</em> sure it will not affect anything)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Create a <strong>pull request</strong> modifying the release notes for the next release.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Edit the file using instructions included on the page (Change types are explained near bottom of the page)</p></li>
<li><p>Save your changes to a branch under same name as your ticket changes branch and add pull request</p></li>
<li><p>Include link to your ticket in pull request description</p></li>
<li><p>Link up your pull request in the ticket as a comment. It is helpful for the reviewer to have a comment clearly listing all of the relevant pull requests and documentation changes, including release notes, that they should review.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Try to get an informal review to check for glaring problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Either on the ticket under the Projects section use the drop-down menu to move the ticket to the review column or manually move the ticket to the bottom of the review column (unless it is of high priority, in that case, move it to the top).</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Pick a ticket to review from the top of the review column. Review the ticket and if it is good close it (this will move it to the review complete) and add the complete label. If it needs work then add the rework label and move it back to the top of the ready column (you should inform the assignee that it is back in rework so they know how to prioritise their work). You must do a review when you move any ticket to the review column even if it is a rework. (A rework ticket review counts as a review).</p></li>
<li><p>Make sure to check the associated <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/blob/master/release_notes/ReleaseNotes_Upcoming.md">upcoming release notes</a> PR makes sense and merge it.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Sometimes you may want to split a larger ticket into smaller tickets to do this see <a class="reference internal" href="Umbrella-Tickets.html"><span class="doc std std-doc">Umbrella Tickets</span></a>.</p>
</section>
<section id="flash-reviews">
<h2>Flash reviews<a class="headerlink" href="#flash-reviews" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>Some work is very small and doesn’t warrant a full ticket and process e.g. fix a code comment, fix trivial Makefile error stopping build working. Such changes should have no potential side effects and take ~5 minutes to review. The procedure is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>create a PR</p></li>
<li><p>post PR into the flash-reviews Teams channel</p></li>
<li><p>we are using emojis to indicate status and avoid creating a new line that a reply/comment would. We don’t want tickets disappearing off the top of the screen. The emojis to use are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>when somebody is looking at it, they add a “surprised” emoji</p></li>
<li><p>if you are done and merged, add a “happy”</p></li>
<li><p>if it is not a flash review and needs further changes, comment on github ticket and add a “sad” face</p></li>
