## Create a spell checking utility for the wikis
- Developer: Adrian/Tom
- Reviewer: None
- Current status: Ready for review

As a developer, I would like the wiki to be spell checked so that I can be confident in the high quality of language use in the documentation.

I'm writing this as a general purpose unit test framework for the wikis so that we can add additional tests later on.

The code is here:

https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/ibex_wiki_checker

There are lots of improvements and optimisations that can still be made to the language processing, but it's a start.
