## Items from last retrospective:

- Manual testing: Use GitHub project board now.
- Deploy Script: Automated unit tests are needed to make sure.
FA recommends maybe using a config file (predefined answers for steps), further discussion needs to take place to decide how we want to move forward with this.
- Code review: Happened and was successful.
- Modular Instrument Control Virtual Machines: Another code chat this Friday is coming up but this will be the topic of discussion for next one.
- Korea EPICS Meeting: There is a lengthier discussion in our teams channel. JH is the only one that the team and management can justify to send. The reasons include that training does not appear to be general/as useful as anticipated. Another reason is the limited budget.

## Items from this retrospective:

- KB: Item carried over (to the next sprint planning) were left in same order: everyone seems to be fine with that, saves a bit of time.
- ZK: move code review extension to Thursday, KB acted on it and works well
- JH recommends putting screenshots in the release notes. Ideas:
    - Put more context and pictures into ticket header
    - Place image links in the Release Notes (not images themselves)
    Specific implementation is not clear yet.
