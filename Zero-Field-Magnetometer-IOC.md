## Purpose

The magnetometer reads magnetic field strengths from the beamline. This IOC takes the magnetometer signal, applies corrections and performs a check to make sure that the magnetometer has not been overloaded.

This IOC is designed to be used in conjunction with a sequencer IOC, which uses the field values to calculate corrections needed to maintain a magnetic field strength. When a new field value is reqiured, the sequencer will process the `$(P)TAKEDATA` PV of this IOC. When the new field values are available, this IOC processes `$(PVPREFIX):ZFCNTRL_01:INPUTS_UPDATED.PROC`, which it expects to allow the sequencer IOC to continue its calculations. This PV can be changed by setting the `$(SQNCR)` macro.

## Corrections applied to the input fields

The maths which defines these operations is described in finer detail [here](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/ibex_developers_manual/wiki/Zero-field-controller#zero-field-controller-feedback-loop).

1. Magnetometer range scaling
   - The three field components are multiplied by a scaling factor to transform the input on to the range of the magnetemeter. The scaling factor is set by the macro `$(RANGE)`, and is held in the PV `$(P)RANGE`.

2. Applying offsets
   - Each component has a unique offset which is subtracted from the scaled data. These offsets are set as the macros `$(OFFSETX), $(OFFSETY), $(OFFSETZ)`. These can also be set by the PVs `$(P):X:OFFSET` and from the OPI.

3. Multiply with sensor matrix
   - To obtain the corrected field strengths, the scaled and offset values need to be multiplied by a 'field sensor' matrix.
   - Macros define the sensor matrix: `$(MATRIX_X_Y)`, where X and Y are the row and column indices.
   - PVs hold the elements of the sensor matrix: `$(P)SENSORMATRIX:XY`. These PVs can also be changed on the OPI.
   - The multiplication iteslf is done as an aSub record. This allows us to use the libraries available to us through GSL.
   - Set up using GSL vector and matrix structures, performing the matrix multiplication is a relatively straightforward call to a vector/matrix multiplication BLAS routine in GSL.
   - The documentation for GSL data structures used is [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/vectors.html).
   - The GSL documentation for BLAS routines is lacking (see [documentation](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/doc/html/blas.html)). To get more in-depth information about the arguments used I would look up the routine in the [BLAS documentation](http://www.netlib.org/blas/).

4. Output
   - The corrected field strengths are written directly to the PVs `$(P)X:CORRECTEDFIELD` from the aSub record.
   - The aSub record also calculates the magnitude of the corrected field and places it in `$(P)FIELDSTRENGTH`.

## Overload

High field values will overload the magnetometer, which is detected in this IOC. The overload condition for the EMU magnetometer is:

`max(measured_field) > magnetometer_range * 4.5`

Where:
   - max(measured_field) is the largest component of the 3 scaled (but not offset or matrix multiplied) input field strenghts.
   - magnetometer_range is the scaling factor used in the magnetometer range scaling
   - 4.5 is a constant taken from the EMU VI. This value may be different for other magnetometers.
