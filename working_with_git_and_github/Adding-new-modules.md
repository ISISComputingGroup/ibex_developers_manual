There are two use cases for adding a submodule:

1. When the code is new, e.g. for a support module for a new device (Marked with **New** below)
1. When importing code from a 3rd Party (Marked with **3rd party** below)

## 1 Create submodule in GitHub

1. Create a new GitHub repository using the "new repository" button on https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup. The naming conventions are:

    *  EPICS submodules should have an "EPICS-" prefix, e.g. for support modules. 

2. Start choice:
    * **3rd Party** Create a blank repository i.e. without a README, licence or .gitignore file. 

    * **New** Create with a readme. Use ISIS .gitignore files.

1. Decide on public or private repository, if you create it private one you can easily make it public later, but there is a limit on how many private repositories we can have at any one time. Repositories should be private if we do not wish to share the code.

1. Click `Create Repository`

1. Add team access

    - Select Settings tab
    - Collaborators & Teams (left)
    - Teams and add ICP-Write group with write access to the repository
    - If it is a private repository add ICP-Read as read only access.

## 2 Get the repository

1. Move to a new branch in the EPICS directory for your ticket. 
1. Create a directory root for the submodule, e.g. for danfysik in support

    cd EPICS/support
    mkdir danfysikMps8000

1. Add a Makefile in the directory, copy it from e.g. ../calc/Makefile  
1. Create a macro for the repository in `...EPICS\configure\MASTER_RELEASE` 
1. Adjust the Makefile in the parent directory to include the new module, e.g. add to `SUPPDIRS` in `...EPICS\support\Makefile`.
1. Add all changes to git.

## 3a *3rdParty* Initial import

Software imported from outside should use a "vendor branch" so new versions are easy to merge in. 

1. Create new git repository called master:

    cd EPICS/support/danfysik8000
    mkdir master
    cd master
    git init

1. Unpack the initial vendor code. Often unpacking the code on Linux is preferred as there are less line endings issues.
1. If it unpacks to something like 1-11/... then move everything up a level. You want the top level directory to contain the usual EPICS configure and *App directory layout. 
1. Delete any files that are not source files or directories e.g. O.Common, O.linux-x86 , top level bin and lib, db that might have got left in.  
1. Delete any .svn directories and files that end in a ~ (temporary files). Then add the files and push to GitHub
 
    git add .
    git commit -m "Imported danfysik 8000 version 1.11"
    git remote add origin https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/EPICS-danfysik8000.git
    git push -u origin master

1. Create the vendor branch

    git checkout -b vendor
    git tag -a vendor_1_11 -m "Tag of danfysik 8000 import version 1.11"
    git push origin vendor
    git push --tags

1. Switch to the branch for your ticket (When you create the pull request it can be created from this branch to master):

    git checkout TicketXXX_description

1. Make local changes. 
    - Create a readme.md to say where we got the code originally from 
    - Add an initial .gitattributes and .gitignore (often using a copy from an older repo).

1. Make sure it builds. You'll probably need to update `configure/RELEASE` to be like e.g. `../calc/master/configure/RELEASE`. Also check the Makefile for both *App and *app targets as well as iocBoot and iocboot - on windows this results in a double match due to case insensitivity, so remove the the *app and iocboot

## 3b *New* Initial import

1. Clone the repository in to the correct directory with the directory name master:

    cd EPICS/support/danfysik8000
    git clone https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/<repo name>.git master

1. Switch to the branch for your ticket (When you create the pull request it can be created from this branch to master):

    git checkout TicketXXX_description

1. Edit/Create a readme.md to say what the module does 
1. Add an initial .gitattributes and .gitignore (often using a copy from an older repo).

## 4 Adding module as submodule

1. Add the new repository as a submodule:
    ```
    cd EPICS/support/danfysik8000
    git submodule add https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/EPICS-danfysikMps8000.git master
    ```
1. Add the files generated by adding the submodule
    ````
    cd EPICS
    git add .gitmodules
    git commit -m "Add danfysikMps8000 submodule"
    ````
1. Next make sure that the whole thing builds from the parent level.
    ````
    make
    git status
    ````
1. Adjust `.gitignore` and `.gitattributes` to make sure they don't contain file that you have just built. Check `make clean uninstall` works. 

Once all the changes are done then create a pull request in the usual way for the new code in EPICS and the new module.

## Updating vendor branch

First checkout the vendor branch and remove all files

    git checkout vendor
    rm -fr *

Then unpack the new code into the directory in the same was as above. You'll have files added, removed and changed to handle. Type  git status  and remove unwanted files like like binaries and temporary files as described above. Then type  

    git add -u .

This will add changed files. Again check with a   git status  that all is looking right before using 

    git add .

to add new and remove deleted files. Then commit and tag the changes

    git commit -m "Imported danfysik 8000 version 1.12"
    git tag -a vendor_1_12 -m "Tag of danfysik 8000 import version 1.12"
    git push origin vendor
    git push --tags

Now you need to go back to your ticket branch and merge in new version of vendor code

    git checkout TicketXXX_
    git pull
    git merge vendor_1_12

And resolve conflicts before committing
