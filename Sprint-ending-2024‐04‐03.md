# Items from last retrospective
- items fromlast sprint left in same order- all good
- code reviews moved to thursday - been finding it good
- More context and pictures in ticket headers, screenshots in release notes
  - packing release notes full of images felt impracticle, put links instead
  - image added to ticket header by developer before putting it into review
  - image will be on the branch you're workng on

# Items from the current retrospective

## Looking at ISIS beam status page at standup in cycle
- a lot of time beam is off without us realising
- will give us context for the day with regards to possible scheduling
- could make just a PV on our dashboard, if you want more news look at the teams channel
- pushback about adding another check to morning standup instead of 

## Ticket context
- Want bad examples of tickets, action on ES for this
- Will bring this up again next retro
- Should we have alonger planning meeting to properly go over what a ticket would entail, and make sure it is written properly with correct acceptance criteria?
  - Will run into problem where "the person whose domain this ticket belongs to" is absent
  - This was something we used to do a bit of in pre-planning
  - Is it worth recording planning meetings so we can reference the discussion later (timekeeper)
  - Possibly have a note-taker for planning, will try it in next planning 

## Ordering the priority columns in planning
- People seem to pick up the tickets that they feel able to do/interested in
- Position in ready does (or at least should) influence order tickets are taken
- Feeling theat it may not matter too much with 6-monthly releases, however patches change this
- Prioritising adds more time to talking about tickets, however planning meetings are already very short
- Sometimes people skip tickets because it's in an area they aren't familiar enough with, or is not clear what needs to be done
- Enforcing the order will push people into areas they're not comfortable, which would be good in the long term
  - We're allowed to make mistakes, you don't have to succeed from the outset (especially if it is't urgent)

## Splitting PM duties
- KB to split duties with GR

## Make sure flash reiews don;t get missed
- track on github, flash reviews column on task board
- checking the teams channel on monday is good, but there's a chance tickets get buried

## Finding out tickets aren't needed
- this has happened in the past, we try our best, sometimes we are given incorrect information
- When picking up a ticket, verify with scientists what exactly they want for it (add this to the dev wiki)
  - Alternatively contact relevant sample environment team

## standup length
- keep it to fewer points
- keep engaged during checking of tests/instrument health

## github actions
- might be useful instead of jenkins builds
- spin up a windows environment for us
- started looking into a few, can be difficult
- where it's easy, try it, run it in parallel with existing builds, turn of the jenkins versions when no longer needed
- wiki check might be easy enough to move
  - friday ticket to do this
  - KB already trying to move project board checks
- not sure if we can have project level actions
  - actions are repo level, org level we'd need an app, however we can make our own (KB already trying this)

## Mad sad glad
- LJ Friday went well, had both meetings, interesting tickets, completed in time
- SC glad he tried programming elsewhere in EPICS
  - Some OPI standards were difficult to find, in fact most hidden in checker script
  - we don't have a standards page, but we do have an example template OPI we should use
  - perhaps make a friday ticket to make the checker script more clearer
- ZK glad about description of the ticket that didn't end up being needed
- ZK glad SC bringing new tools into the meeting
  - happy to try it, but many of us unsure about its used
