A technical debt stand-down day is a day devoted to fixing technical debt in the system. The format is:

1. Choose a day where most people are free
1. Choose a topic: examples
    - Squish tests
    - Eclipse/CSS interaction
    - Tech debt tickets
    - Block server exception handling
    - Deployment/release process
    - Bugs
    - Emulator/IOC tests
    - Excess logging
    - Dataweb/dashboard improvements

People pick up tickets when they get in often working in pairs. There is an extra standup at 4pm to discuss what has been done. This is the moment to choose to either:

- stop working on a ticket (commit everything to a branch and add it to the ticket to be picked up later)
- move it into the current sprint
- ensure a ticket is reviewed

Try to make sure all tickets by the end of the day are in a good state.
