## Items from this retrospective:

### Attempting return to scrum poker online due to contiued issues with planitpoker

### Squish test rota
 - Attempt to slowly increase squish test coverage of manual system tests 
	- The developer who is on standup that week
		- Not everyone can do this.
			- Thats fine, only if developer is capable
			- Week on standup, add one squish test to replace a manual system test.


### Another Away Day
 - Last away day was organised from higher up
 - What topic would be covered
	- Longterm plans for team?
	- Review of topics covered at last away day?

### Central Archiving
 - SQL server hosted by SCD or anyone else
	- Do we have time to focus on this?
		- How much time do we lose truncating databases?
			- not nessecarily related to this, still likely need to truncated could implement auto truncation when its also in central location
	- this would be a good thing to do, but possibly a longterm issue
	- possibly use Archiver appliance?
	- Out of hours support from SCD issues

### Private documentation
- If we make documentation private we can put in non public information in, possibly sharepoint because it's already GDPR compliant
- need someone to take time to look into it.
	- not the highest priority
- More document fragmentation will make information even easier to miss.
	- link to the sharepoint pages from the wiki, that way still single point of entry.
