1. Want to put Tools in one place. [John: maybe 2 - deployed and non-deployed]. Examples are

        - caget
        - archive data grabber
        - ioc generator
        - installation and upgrade scripts.

1. OPI Python logic should be tested, for future OPIs test logic.
    - see [#3619](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/issues/3619) 
1. Change meeting lengths, planning should be 30 mins shorted and prep should be 30 minutes longer.
1. Create a ticket to look at removing stale branches.[#3620](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/issues/3620) 
1. OPI should be sent to scientist for who it is being developer (added to IOCworkflow and [OPI Creation](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/ibex_developers_manual/wiki/OPI-Creation))
1. Add Readme to all submodules explaining purpose, these can link to documents in module especially for standard epics docs. This is so everyone knows what things do. It would also be good to remove old code submodules that are not needed and generate dependency lists.

1. Finally looked at cycle problems slack channel. This is not a good method of recording these let think of something else.
