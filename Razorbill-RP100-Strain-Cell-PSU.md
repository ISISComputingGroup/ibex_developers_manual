Razorbill RP100 Strain Cell PSU

This is a small power supply (±200V, ±6mA) used to drive a piezoelectric strain cell.  It has a USB interface which connects to an AnywhereUSB USB<->Ethernet adapter on the beamline, or a local PC for testing/setup.

WISH are the primary users of this device and previously have had to borrow one from SE Electronics Group, but now have their own unit.
