Previous logic of the ioc had this logic for sending mode params:

This logic is probably in connection with changing from PULSE to none PULSE versions of the MODE setpoint. The calculation part
takes care of switching to the right mode with respect to the specified order of modes in the mbbo in record MODE:SP

### Model 2023A

In db file at `aeroflexSup\aeroflex_2023A.db`
```
record(calcout, "$(P)SEND_MODE_PARAMS")
{
    field(DESC, "Set modulation button")
    field(SCAN, "Passive")
	field(INPA, "$(P)MODE:SP_NO_ACTION")
	field(INPB, "$(P)PULSE_CHECK:SP")
	field(CALC, "(B = 0) ? ((2 * A) + 1) : (2 * A)")
	field(OUT, "$(P)MODE:SP PP")
}
```

### Model 2030

In db file at `aeroflexSup\aeroflex_2030.db`
```
record(calcout, "$(P)SEND_MODE_PARAMS")
{
    field(DESC, "Set modulation button")
    field(SCAN, "Passive")
	field(INPA, "$(P)MODE:SP_NO_ACTION")
	field(INPB, "$(P)PULSE_CHECK:SP")
	field(CALC, "((B=1)&&(A>2))?(A-3):(A+2)")
	field(OUT, "$(P)MODE:SP PP")
}
```

These are now removed.
