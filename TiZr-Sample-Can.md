# TiZr Sample Can

The main project is one that sees the building and integration of a sample can such as was used in an experiment in the mid-1990s. The sample container is designed to contain steam at 580K and 95 bar. This will be used for an experiment on NIMROD.

The assembly will consist of a stainless steel reservoir for the sample (either H20 or D20) which will then be evaporated into the TiZr cell. The pressure will generally be managed by the temperature. A manually controlled needle valve will be used during setup to limit the pressure should the reservoir be overfilled. A pressure gauge which outputs 0V to 10V will be used to report the pressure.

From an IBEX perspective, the standard Triple Eurotherm on NIMROD will be used to read and control the temperature of the reservoir and the cell, with readings for the cell from both the top and bottom of the cell. Another Eurotherm crate will be brought in to read the temperature of the pipework after the cell and the pressure within the cell.

In a meeting on the 20th of April 2020 no other data collection or recurring calculations were identified, which means that the IBEX setup is limited to configuration items, and as such, no tickets have been created at this time.
