In order to make sure that IOC descriptions, and how they appear in the IOC selection list is understandable the IOC Description in the config.xml should consist of the following items, in this order:

1. Manufacturer (for example Agilent) or originating facility (typically this will be ISIS)
2. Model/Series for devices (for example E3613A), IBEX or instrument/group - this part can be omitted if it would create more confusion that it causes for a particular IOC
3. What it is/does (e.g. waveform generator, jaws manager)

### Examples of IOC Descriptions
* Agilent 33220A 20MHz waveform generator
* ISIS IBEX Reflectometry Server
* ISIS DAE
