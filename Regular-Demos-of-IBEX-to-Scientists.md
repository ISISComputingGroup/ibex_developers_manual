The regular 4-week Sprint Review is not the ideal forum for demonstrating new developments in IBEX to scientists. Instead, we will demonstrate each new release of IBEX prior to its deployment to groups of instrument scientists (or, when appropriate, to individual instrument scientists).  Demos will be arranged as follows:
1. Developers pair off to demonstrate IBEX to each group of instrument scientists.  
1. One member of each pair takes the initiative to contact the scientists to arrange the demo.  
1. Ideally, arrange the the demo to happen out of cycle and near the end of a sprint (that’s what is most convenient to both scientists & developers), but demos can be held at other times, if necessary.
1. Choose a convenient location to perform the demo (e.g. in the instrument cabin or a scientist's office (if there is room), or a meeting room)
1. Demo all the changes since the last release (or previous demo), with emphasis on those items of most relevance to the instrument
1. Gather and share feedback (e.g. on instrument wiki pages)

Over time we can change the pairs, so that everybody gets exposed to different instruments & instrument scientists.

Use the [sprint/release demos](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/wiki/Timetable-for-sprint-demos) page to plan each round of demos..
