### Once a deploy has been finished and the ticket requires a review the following tasks should be done to review the ticket:

- Connect to the machines deployed to and check the current versions of the GUI and server. (In the gui select about, the GUI and Server version numbers should be listed).
- Check that any hotfixes have appropriate tickets.
- Ensure hotfixes are linked at https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/wiki#instrument-information--hotfixes, and versions are linked at http://beamlog.nd.rl.ac.uk/inst_summary.xml.
- Ensure there is a ticket for demonstrating changes between the old version and the newly deployed version.
