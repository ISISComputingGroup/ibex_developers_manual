This is not a device we support as a group (there is no obvious documentation on how it can be controlled remotely, other than with the supplied software), but is set up independently using it's own proprietary software. It was last seen on SANS2D. 

The following are some notes for context should a support call be received:
* The device outputs a trigger signal via a cable hard wired to the DAE
* The device was last used connected to a laptop in the sample area with a remote desktop connection to this from the cabin over wired ethernet. The Laptop ran the manufacturer software
* The last time we saw it, it was connected by USB. a previous device used serial to the laptop. There is some suggestion the USB connection may time out if idle for too long. 
* In any case the device itself is not connected to the ISIS network or the moxa and is not accessed through IBEX.
