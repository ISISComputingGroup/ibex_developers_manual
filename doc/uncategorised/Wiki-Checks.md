We have a Jenkins pipeline for tests that check if our wikis are grammatically correct, that they reference valid links, and so on. It checks the developer's Wiki, the IBEX User's manual and the IBEX Wiki.

Further detail, including on how to run the Wiki Checker locally can be found in the read me of the repository.
