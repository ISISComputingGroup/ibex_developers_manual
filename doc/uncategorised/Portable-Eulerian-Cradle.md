The portable Eulerian cradle is a motion control device with two spinning axes, one that goes around the other that rotates at 90 degrees to that.

# Trouble shooting

### Motion is Jerky

When it was first setup it seemed that the motion was jerky. While we were there the instrument scientists cleaned the outer ring metal; this helped. Moving the two rings through all there motion helped too. After this there seemed to be no problems, except outer at 90 degrees, the scientist has talked with electronics about this.
