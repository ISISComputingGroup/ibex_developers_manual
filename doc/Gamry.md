The Gamry IOC controls and in-house developed device. This device controls a Gamry via its interface communication port. This was last used on IMAT and work can be seen in the following issue:  [#2642](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/issues/2642)  

Currently there is no specific device driver for these series of devices.
