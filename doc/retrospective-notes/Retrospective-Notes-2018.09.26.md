1. Want to put Tools in one place. [John: maybe 2 - deployed and non-deployed]. Examples are
        - config checker
        - config upgrade
        - caget
        - archive data grabber
        - ioc generator
        - installation and upgrade scripts.
    - Added to [tech debt idea page](Technical-Debt-Stand-down)
1. OPI Python logic should be tested, for future OPIs test logic.
    - see [#3619](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/issues/3619) 
1. Change meeting lengths, planning should be 30 mins shorted and prep should be 30 minutes longer.
1. Create a ticket to look at removing stale branches.[#3620](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/issues/3620) 
1. OPI should be sent to scientist for who it is being developer (added to IOCworkflow and [OPI Creation](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/ibex_developers_manual/wiki/OPI-Creation))
1. Add Readme to all submodules explaining purpose, these can link to documents in module especially for standard epics docs. This is so everyone knows what things do. It would also be good to remove old code submodules that are not needed and generate dependency lists.

1. Finally looked at cycle problems slack channel. This is not a good method of recording these let think of something else.
1. `Friday Days` and `Tech Debt Days` both still important if we have time in the sprint
1. Story points, is it ok? Yes broadly it seems like a good estimation tool.
1. Another Nicos dev? Tom said yes.
