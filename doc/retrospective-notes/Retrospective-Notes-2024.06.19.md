## Items from last retrospective

- EPICS top PR Lowri says that there should be a better way to manage the submodules. Jack offered solution and Lowri updated the wiki page to reflect this.

    Page has been updated and device generator matches it

- If discussion ticket and clear acceptance criteria for outcome of discussion whoever assigned to to create the discussion just does it. If the implementation ends up going beyond the points then make another ticket for the rest of the implementation.

    Create ticket if necessary only.
 
## Items from the current retrospective

- Put PyCharm on NDX-s:
    - Scientists want this instead of Notepad++
    - We want to discourage use of NDX (client-server based approach)
    - Don't want scripts to be run from PyCharm
    - They want: autocomplete and syntax highlight, we want: them not to be able to run scripts from it.
    - Bottom line: we need more context and requirements formalisation (Jack and Lilith might have a good idea on their requirements based on their recent interactions with scientists)

- extra role for planning meetings
    - notetaker will take on this responsibility

- Ticket format:
    - suggestion of reworking the ticket template with some better guidelines on what to include at certain sections (Testing is the one mentioned)
    - reviewer should use what's on the ticket as a starting point and not solely rely on description

- 15 minute rule in standup:
    - fill out first 15 minutes with operations stuff
    - we most of the time don't wait if we know people won't make it
    - seems like it's going to stay as it is
    - come up with alternative solutions and discuss next sprint

- Joining meeting from the office through your PC:
    - Some say it went well, some say it was difficult to hear conversation.
    - result: ok for one-offs but do not intend to make it general

- Certain number of people answer some Jenkins and Nagios checks and results
    - could have a code chat on how to interpret status

## Mad, Sad, Glad

KB: Glad that Tom is back on the team
FA: Glad that the rack is in place and office looks neater thanks to Jack and others in the office helping out, Also glad many tickets went through and migration is going well.
