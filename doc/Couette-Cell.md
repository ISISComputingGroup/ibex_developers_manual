A couette-cell is a device for measuring properties of fluids see (https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/Unilever-Extensional-Shear-Cell.aspx). It is based on a mclennan motor running in one of three modes:

1. Go to a position (either relative to the current position or an absolute position
1. Spin at a constant velocity
1. Move between two positions (in this mode the readbacks will stop working because the mclennan is busy)

This is currently an LVDCOM device.
