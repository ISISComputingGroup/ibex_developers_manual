# TOSCA sample positioner

This is a very simple device controlled via a McLennan motor. There is no readback from the motor - the scientists use a web cam as a readback.

The scientists only require a very basic level of control: coarse and fine relative moves, plus a "stop" button. The distances moved by "coarse" and "fine" relative moves do need to be configurable, however.

The webcam is not always switched on so may not be accessible when testing the OPI.
