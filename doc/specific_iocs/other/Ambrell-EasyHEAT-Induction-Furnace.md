# Ambrell EasyHEAT Induction Furnace

:::{attention}
To date (18/07/2025) the IOC has **not** been tested with hardware nor has the hardware itself.
:::

The IOC for this device communicates with its PSU, and is currently READONLY.  This is a new piece of equipment due to be used on ENGIN-X, and because of that, the scientists will initially control it manually on its local panel, using IBEX to read and log diagnostic data.  It is envisaged that the equipment will be configured manually for a particular experiment and left in that state while neutron data is collected while being monitored from IBEX.

The manual for the PSU, which is stored in the usual network shared area, is unclear as to exactly what strings are returned by the PSU, and in what format.

**More information will be added to this page once the device has been tested along with its IOC.**
