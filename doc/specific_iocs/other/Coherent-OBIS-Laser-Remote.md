# Coherent OBIS Laser Remote

The Coherent OBIS Laser Remote is a small box which connects to one or more lasers and provides status and fault information via LEDs on the front panel. Much more information is provided via the remote interface.

The device allows a minimal set of information to be *set* on the device: laser state and laser power.

The IOC currently supports up to 5 lasers; the address of each laser needs to be set using IOC macros.
