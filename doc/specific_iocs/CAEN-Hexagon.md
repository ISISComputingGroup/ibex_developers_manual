# CAEN Hexagon (MUX Data Acquisition Electronics)

The CAEN hexagon is the data acquisition used on MUX. It is currently controlled by the CAENMCA IOC, of which they run two instances for the two hexagons. They also run their DAE in simulation mode to log sample environment data, then the CAEN syncs run number with the DAE and writes its own data files. 

Data is publicsed to the ususal archive, but to the "autoreduced" subfolder
