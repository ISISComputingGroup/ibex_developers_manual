# SMC100

Newport SMC100 Single-Axis Motor controller.  Used with the [HTS magnet system](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/ibex_developers_manual/wiki/HTS-Magnet), along with the Smartmonitor and two Kepco PSUs in master/slave configuration.

It has a peculiar startup and homing behaviour - after powering up it must be homed and once homed it cannot be homed again.  Unless...

... If the motor refuses to move despite not returning an error code, and an orange/red LED is shown on the front panel, then it simply needs to be re-homed.  This is explained on the diagram and table on the cover of the controller.

If running asyn trace, when it is working you may have nothing printed, so I guess It doesn't look to regularly poll. but all a bit confusion. If you want to run asyn trace, note that the port is called `serial1` rather than `L0`

### Connection

DLS system: connected to laptop via a gender changer. It does not seem to need a null modem.

If using correct-gender cable (female cable), then the device *does* need a null modem.
