# Reflectometry IOC - SURF

Specific information about SURF.

### Blocks

Unlike some reflectometers there is only a single sample height and it is defined by the block:

- `Height`: Distance between the beam and the centre of rotation; usually set to 0. This parameter moves the height stage tracking the beam.

### Slit 3/Beam blocker

There is no [beam blocker](../Reflectometry-Beam-Blocker) setup on SURF.
