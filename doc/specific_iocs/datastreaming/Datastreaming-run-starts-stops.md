# Data streaming: run starts/stops

Run starts and stops will be dealt with by [`kafka_dae_control`](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/kafka_dae_control) and the flatbuffers blobs will be constructed in this process. It may need to be hooked onto by `ISISDAE` for older instruments using DAE2/DAE3 and the ISISICP.
