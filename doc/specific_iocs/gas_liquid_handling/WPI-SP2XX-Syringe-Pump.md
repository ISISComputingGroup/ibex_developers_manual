# WPI SP2XX Syringe Pump

The WPI SP2XX series syringe pump simply infuses and withdraws liquid from the target.

## Connecting the pump

The device requires a specific cable to be connected to a moxa or PC. The cable is grey and has RJ11 to DB9 (female) connections. You should be able to then connect this to a moxa DB9 (male) to RJ45 to communicate with it. The devices front panel will automatically switch to a "Remote" dialog, confirming it is being controlled by the driver.
