# Catalytic Flow Reactor

The Catalytic Flow Reactor equipment is a bespoke piece of user equipment that is going to be used on POLARIS. 

It sends a readout (with no command) over serial every 10 seconds, containing 3 numbers - a state number, block number and an indicator on whether or not to start taking data. There is no write control available for this device. 

It has a sub D-9 port for communication, using RS232.
