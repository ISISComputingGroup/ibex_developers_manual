# Access to ISIS Instrument Halls

To obtain access to the instrument hall, you need to have an SI10 form filled out and sent to the correct person and completed the radiation training. You can then enter the hall with a temporary dosimeter and temporary access given from MCR which lasts until the end of the month.

To gain permanent access to the hall, you need to have a named dosimeter. To obtain a named dosimeter, you need to fill out a named dosimeter form which you can request from R5.5 reception. Once you have a named dosimeter, you can then gain permanent access to the hall from MCR.

**N.B.**
Until you have obtained a named dosimeter, you will not be able to gain permanent access to the instrument hall.
