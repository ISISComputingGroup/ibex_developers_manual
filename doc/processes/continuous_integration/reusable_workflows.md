# reusable workflows

As we have standardised on linting and testing frameworks, many of our repositories would likely just have copy-pasted github actions workflows. 

To avoid this duplication, we have a [repository](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/reusable-workflows) for reusable workflows. When starting a new project you should consider using these first before writing your own repository-specific workflows. 

More information can be found on the [official Github docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/reuse-automations/reuse-workflows).
