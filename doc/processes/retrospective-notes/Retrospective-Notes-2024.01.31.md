## Items from last retrospective:

The items from the last retrospective were recapped, no additional comments were made.

- Weekly coffee rolling rota: LC has created calendar invitations.
- Migrate new project board style: Now checks are done via application rather than automation(?).  May create problems for existing checks if converted.  ZS will try on current PI board and report back.
- Regular Code reviews: Each Monday Standup meeting been extended to 1hr to accommodate code review.  First one this week which went well.  Thanks to JH for stepping in.
- JH mentioned EPICS meeting and asked how many from group would go.  Includes training sessions, so good for new-starters.  April 15th-18th 2024, week before a cycle.  Another EPICS meeting in October and NOBUGS in September.
- KVLB highlighted next sprint is only three weeks to avoid cycle clash.

## Items from this retrospective:

- Manual testing: The manual test process seems to be an improvement now that they’ve been transferred. JH suggested decoupling coupled tests and replace that by adding what the previous test was, or perhaps link them.
- Deploy Script: Discussions regarding the amount of user input required, and simplifying the deploy script. The idea of two deploy scripts or automating the user responses was discussed to retain the ability to alter deployment steps (i.e. in case of rerunning tests). Further discussion requires for this item.
- Code review: It was suggested that code review should be moved to a different day – KB will attempt to do so, if available.
- Modular Instrument Control Virtual Machines: Code-Chat on the topic to be organised by LJ.
- Korea EPICS Meeting: There would need to be justification to send more than two members of staff if there was no training at the event. The event program appears to be incomplete as of this discussion. JH, ES and DM appeared interested in attending. Item was still unresolved, it was suggested that a separate meeting should be set up to discuss signing up to the event.
