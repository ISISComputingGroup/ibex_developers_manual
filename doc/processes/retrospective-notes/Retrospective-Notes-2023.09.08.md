## Items from last retrospective:

### Burndown chart
- Discussed elsewhere (as item in current sprint below)

### Supporting instruments (new starters)
- Keep taking them to the experiment halls to gain experience

### IBEX Training course
- Good idea for all new starters in group, as well as new scientists/support technicians
- Run two courses? e.g. one for ExptCtrls team members and one for scientists

## Items from this retrospective:

### Burndown chart reflecting BAU (now using actual work ratios: IBEX to BAU).
- agree to keep with this as seems to reflect previous sprint productivity reasonably accurately

### Delegating other IBEX project management tasks
- e.g. SE devices project representative and manage group's resulting work
- Action for group to think about which tasks they'd like to take responsibility for.  Can discuss at next retrospective
- Need place to put list of tasks so that people can take them on (e.g. Teams form, tick boxes on ticket/wiki, Outlook task list on ExptCtrls calendar)

### ES asked about reinstating the office screen to display build status etc.
- Need to ask CMS about previous control machine or a replacement

### Winter meal out
- Discussed and that someone (usually a new graduate) should volunteer soon.

### A group activity of some kind would be beneficial and enjoyable.
- ES suggested a visit to CCFE for a tour and then invite them to ISIS in return.
