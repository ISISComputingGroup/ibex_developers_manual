## We still didn't update component stewards

This keeps being missed.

## We should repoint tickets before planning

- Now added as step to [sprint planning](/processes/meetings/Sprint-Planning)

## At least whilst working from home retrospective notes should be put in a dedicated teams channel

## In teams we can't use ticks/crosses easily for flash reviews

- Instead use shocked face emoji as looking, happy face as approved and sad as rejected. 
- Using a spreadsheet is too heavy so remove this

## Should we come up with a template for instrument demos?

Yes, the demo ticket should include this. We should make sure that more junior members of the team have sufficient input in to doing demos.

## Reviews have slowed since moving to working from home

- This could be due to people not being confident in how to review - we should make sure that PRs include instructions on how to review
- We could monitor who is owing reviews but this seems a little draconian, John will look into doing it.
