## Items from last retrospective
- More context and pictures in ticket headers, screenshots in release notes
  - ES pointed to two things: 
1. In certain cases the ticket is otherwise well written but the requirement has changed.
2. [6053](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/issues/6053) is a good example of a well written ticket.

- Flash reviews as task
  - LJ ==> Important that these aren't ignored and picked up with due urgency. On the task board if there are no updates we generally overlook the board. However with flash reviews on the board, no update could mean important reviews haven't been taken up. We need to be careful when checking the task board.
 
## Items from the current retrospective
- Going to carry on not prioritising the columns in planning
- Flash reviews are on task boards. If the board isn't updated, we still need to check the flash review items.
- Moving to online meeting also from office
  - SC ==> Offline meetings restrict us from using online tools. They also mean that meeting rooms are booked - sometimes much bigger than the number of members present.
  - KB ==> Issues with hearing and not comfortable with multiple people talking even with noise cancellation headphones.
  - LJ ==> Issues with echo and delay in delivery.
  - We're going to keep having meetings as hybrid, as multiple people in  a zoom call in the same room is limiting for some of the team
- Discussions on Burndown chart
  - KB explained that the burndown chart isn't typical burndown chart, but customized for ISIS. 
  - LC suggested to invert the Y axis of the graph.
- Discussions around rotating logs off
  - CMS ==> When is the file closed and available for moving/truncating/copying - also applies particularly to console logs? When to truncate the DB?

## Mad sad glad
- LC glad that user training went well, interesting discussions.
- DK glad Chronus is working well despite some niggles.
  - glad additional people on the support call is helpful
  - sad there is an increase in support calls.
