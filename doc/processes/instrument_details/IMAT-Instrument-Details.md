# IMAT

This page collects information that will be useful for the implementation of the new control system on IMAT.
## Background & Timeline ##
The [IMAT](http://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/instruments/imat/imat8259.html) web page describes the background to the instrument.  Additional material is also available on the [IMAT sharepoint](http://www.facilities.rl.ac.uk/isis/projects/ts2/phase2instruments/IMAT/Forms/AllItems.aspx).

Slides sets from IMAT operational review of 21st May 2014 are available: [Intro](http://www.facilities.rl.ac.uk/isis/projects/ts2/phase2instruments/IMAT/Reviews/IMAT%20Operational%20Review%20intro.pdf), [Science](http://www.facilities.rl.ac.uk/isis/projects/ts2/phase2instruments/IMAT/Reviews/IMAT%20Operational%20Review%20-Science.pdf), [Engineering](http://www.facilities.rl.ac.uk/isis/projects/ts2/phase2instruments/IMAT/Reviews/IMAT%20Operational%20Review%20-%20Main.pdf).

{#imat_noteSKFChoppers}
##### Note: SKF Choppers #####
IMAT will have three sets of choppers: a double-disk chopper, a T0 chopper and a second double-disk chopper.  All three SKF choppers use the same control system: see [SKF Modbus/TCP interface](http://www.facilities.rl.ac.uk/isis/computing/ICPdiscussions/IMAT/892-0117%20Rev%20B%20modbus%20(Updated%202014-10-17).pdf) for details.  Instrument scientists would like to control choppers as 5 independent disks.  There is also a need to "park" the choppers in the open position (to allow white beam imaging).

{#imat_noteBeamAttenuator}
##### Note: Beam Attenuator #####
The purpose of beam attenuator is to protect the sample & camera while either is being positioned.  The time taken to open/close the beam attenuator is about 1s.  Driven by pneumatic actuator between limits (2 limit switches).  Position is In/Out. Must communicate with sample positioner - needs both automatic operation and manual control.  Also communicate with data acquisition (c.f. Pause/resume on SANS2D) and camera system.  See [IMAT Fast Shutter](http://www.facilities.rl.ac.uk/isis/computing/ICPdiscussions/IMAT/IMAT_Computing_FastShutter.pptx) for a diagram. **Note:** the beam attenuator was originally known as the "fast shutter", but this name is now deprecated. See also: [IMAT Sample Attenuator Minutes](http://www.facilities.rl.ac.uk/isis/computing/ICPdiscussions/IMAT/IMAT_SampleAttenuator_M5_computing_minutes_29Oct2014.docx).

{#imat_noteOMRONplc}
##### Note: OMRON PLC #####
The OMRON PLC will be used to control gate valves and instrument vacuum.  It will also be used for control of the pneumatic actuator for the Beam Attenuator.

{#imat_notePinhole}
##### Note: Pinhole Selector #####
The Pinhole Selector is a wheel containing mounts for 6 pinhole apertures - set positions for each.  Single axis motion control (stepper motor). Controlled by Galil.  See [IMAT Pin Hole Selector](http://www.facilities.rl.ac.uk/isis/computing/ICPdiscussions/IMAT/IMAT_Computing_PinHoleSelector.pptx) for a diagram.  See also: [IMAT Pin Hole Selector Details](http://www.facilities.rl.ac.uk/isis/computing/ICPdiscussions/IMAT/PinholeSelector_2014.pdf) and [IMAT Pin Hole Selector Minutes](http://www.facilities.rl.ac.uk/isis/computing/ICPdiscussions/IMAT/IMAT_PinholeSelector_Computing_minutes_28Nov2014.docx).

{#imat_noteJaws}
##### Note: Jaws #####
5 x beam-collimating jaw-sets, controlled by Galil. <br>See [IMAT Jaws & Collimating Slits](http://www.facilities.rl.ac.uk/isis/computing/ICPdiscussions/IMAT/IMAT_Computing_Jaws_Collimating_Slits.pptx) for a diagram.  See also: [IMAT Jaws/Slits Minutes](http://www.facilities.rl.ac.uk/isis/computing/ICPdiscussions/IMAT/IMAT_Jaws-Slits_computing_minutes_17Nov2014.docx)

{#imat_noteSlits}
##### Note: Slits #####
X-Y slits (2 linear translations), controlled by Galil. <br>See [IMAT Jaws & Collimating Slits](http://www.facilities.rl.ac.uk/isis/computing/ICPdiscussions/IMAT/IMAT_Computing_Jaws_Collimating_Slits.pptx) for a diagram.

{#imat_noteMonitors}
##### Note: Monitors #####
6 monitors, controlled by Galil. In/Out set positions.

1. M1 is positioned immediately upstream of the first double-disk chopper.
2. M2 is positioned immediately upstream of the second double-disk chopper.
3. M3 is positioned immediately downstream of the second double-disk chopper.
4. M4 is positioned immediately downstream of the pin-hole selector.
5. M5 is positioned immediately downstream of the beam attenuator.  See [IMAT M5 Monitor](http://www.facilities.rl.ac.uk/isis/computing/ICPdiscussions/IMAT/IMAT_Computing_M5Monitor.pptx) for a diagram of the M5 monitor.
6. M6 position - to be communicated. 

{#imat_noteSampleStack}
##### Note: Sample Positioning System #####
Comprises upper and lower stacks.<br>
Lower stack has X, Y & Z translational degrees of freedom, plus rotational degree of freedom about the Z-axis. Z range = 0-1000mm, X & Y ranges = +/-500mm. Rotation is 0-370 degrees.<br>
Upper stack will be an "off-the-shelf" tomography stack (3 rotational degrees of freedom). Most axes motors will be controlled by Galil (using Galil 4400 firmware).<br>
Some axes motors will be controlled by a Beckhoff system (further details required).<br>
Sample stack needs to communicate with fast shutter.<br>
See [IMAT Sample Positioning System](http://www.facilities.rl.ac.uk/isis/computing/ICPdiscussions/IMAT/IMAT_Computing_SamplePositioning.pptx) for a diagram. 

{#imat_noteSampleEnvironment}
##### Note: Sample Environment #####
For information about the IMAT sample environment see: [â€‹IMAT Sample Environment](http://www.facilities.rl.ac.uk/isis/computing/ICPdiscussions/IMAT/IMAT_SampleEnvironment_Dec2014.pdf) and [IMAT Sample Environment Minutes](http://www.facilities.rl.ac.uk/isis/computing/ICPdiscussions/IMAT/IMAT_SampleEnvironment_Minutes_17Dec2014.docx). 

{#imat_noteCameraRobot}
##### Note: Camera Positioning Robot #####
Details of robot positioning system are yet to be decided.  In practice, control of the camera positioning robot may be handled separately from the instrument control system.  See [IMAT Camera](http://www.facilities.rl.ac.uk/isis/computing/ICPdiscussions/IMAT/IMAT_Computing_Camera.pptx) for a illustration of the concept.
