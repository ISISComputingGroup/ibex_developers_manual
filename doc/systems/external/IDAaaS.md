You need to login with user office credentials, which can be you fed id or user@stfc.ac.uk email address. However you need to make sure you have a user office account id and that this is linked to your fed id. 

If you haven't signed up for a User Office account before, you should be able to request one using your stfc email address at https://users.facilities.rl.ac.uk/ Once you have done that, if you login, select "My Details" at the top of the page, you should see a button on the left hand side saying "Request Fed ID". This will give you an option to link it to your Federal ID.
