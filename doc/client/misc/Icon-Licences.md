# Icon Licences

Icon licences are available to view in the IBEX GUI from the `Help -> Icon Licences` dialog on the main window.

## Crediting icon licences

When adding new icons ensure that the correct licence is included in the icon licences file. This is located at `uk.ac.stfc.isis.ibex.e4.ui.help.resources/iconlicences.txt`. The icon licences file is structured so that each package has a subsection with a path to the icons resource folder. The icons name must be listed and the associated licence.
