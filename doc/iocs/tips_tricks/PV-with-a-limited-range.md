# PV with a limited range

If a setpoint on a device has a range set by the device it should be set up by using DRVH and DRVL. This will limit the value that can be set and set it to the largest possible value which will allow scripts to do the best possible. [See [Decision Log 12](/processes/Decision-Log)]
