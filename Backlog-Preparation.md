Backlog preparation is the meeting where we decide on most of the candidate tickets for a sprint and rank them by importance.

### Preparation

1. Announce at standup that people should move tickets to proposal
1. Before the backlog pruning meeting people should move tickets to the 'proposal' column they would like to see in the next sprint; all the tickets that must be in and a maximum of 2 extras per person. 
1. Print out the tickets so that they can be ordered in the meeting. To do this
    - list issues with label `proposal` in github
    - copy and paste into notepad++
    - replace `(#\d\d\d\d).*` with `\1\n\n`
    - replace single digits on a line with nothing
    - copy to word
    - alter font to 40 for titles and big and 72 for numbers make sure it is 2 per page 
    - print and cut

### During the meeting

At the meeting, we will look at these tickets discuss what they are and then rank their importance. 

1. Look at each ticket and decide whether it makes sense, edit if needed
1. Decide on rank on importance and urgency and add to pile
1. Order tickets by priority starting with important and urgent

### After the Meeting

1. Collect tickets in order and write order into slack
1. Look at any IOC tickets and get someone to do an analysis of difficulty.
