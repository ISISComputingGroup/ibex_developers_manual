**Component:** An item on the beamline that interacts with the beam in some way (tracking or modifying its path)

**Incoming Beam:** The beam as described by position and angle at the point where its path last changed before a given component.

**Parameter:** A top-level user parameter, describing some value relative to the incoming beam.

**Straight Through Beam:** The beam as described by its position and angle when it enters the blockhouse. The coordinate system used by the reflectometry IOC is relative to the straight through beam, i.e. a component at height 0 would sit in the centre of the straight through beam.
