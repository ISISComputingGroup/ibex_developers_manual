# No tests Run

Look in console log. We found the lines:

```
RCPTT Runner version: 2.0
An error has occurred. See the log file
C:\Jenkins\workspace\System_Tests\Results\runner-workspace\.metadata\.log.
```

In this log it couldn't read open a given jar file. This appeared to be a problem with the version of RCPPT. So ran manually on reno and fixed the problems.
