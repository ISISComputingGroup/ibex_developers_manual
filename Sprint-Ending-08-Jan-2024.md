# Previous sprint

## No notes of significance

# Current Sprint

## Calendar now shows First Line Support allocations

## The Christmas meal was excellent and well organised

## PAT testing and SW Release
CMS raised the forthcoming scheduled PAT testing. We should consider synchronising the next software release activities around it and also how best to restore systems to their states prior to PAT testing equipment shutdown.

# Mad/Glad/Sad
- LJ Glad - Had a good break over the Christmas holidays.
- KB Glad - People managed to extend the Christmas break somewhat.
