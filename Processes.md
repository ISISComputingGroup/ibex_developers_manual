Various Processes for Tasks and quick into into how they should work

## Creation of Tickets

Tickets should be created at need by developers as git issues using the waffle board. Initially they should *not* have a milestone attached to them unless they are needed for a definite date and this is the LATEST that they could possible be started. If you are doing this ensure that there is enough time for testing; bugs fixing etc.

## Backlog Pruning

Before the backlog pruning meeting product champions should add a proposed flag to tickets they would like to see in the next sprint. At the meeting we will look at these tickets as a priority and as many newly created tickets as we can. Proposed flags will then be added or removed depending on the general consensus. (Do we need a scientist propose flag too so these don't get lost?).

## Sprint Planning

At sprint planning we will *only* look at tickets with proposed flags. These will be selected in priority order and added to the ready column. Estimates will be added (should we start estimating in half days to avoid the 0.5 problem?). After sprint planning all proposed flags will be removed from all tickets.

## Movement of Tickets

Developers should pick up a ticket as close to the top of the Ready column as they can (i.e. don't pick a ticket assigned to someone else). Assign the ticket to yourself and move it to in progress. When the ticket is done move it to the top of the review column (unless it is high priority in that case move it to the bottom). Then pick a ticket to review from the bottom of the review column. Review the ticket and move it either to the review complete or add the rework label and move it back to the top of the ready column (it is a courtesy to inform the person you have done this).

## Adding tickets Mid Sprint

If you are adding a ticket to the ready column mid sprint. Please make sure it is added in priority order with estimates attached. If you can get someone to read it to make sure it makes sense.

## Friday Quality Time

Developers like quality time, on Friday afternoon a developer may choose a ticket that can be completed in a couple of hours. Good candidates are 0 time tickets from the backlog. NB These tickets are not a priority it is just for fun :-)
