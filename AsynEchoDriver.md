Asyn provides an echo driver that will return on a read what was last provided by a write. This can
be used for some very basic stream device testing / simulation e.g. if the real function is
``
getFrequency {
    out "FREQ?"; in "%f";
}
``

Then by connecting the device to the echo driver you could write

``
getFrequency {
    out "10.0"; in "%f";
}
``

Potentially you could have both a real  getFrequency()  and a dummy getFrequencyTest() function in the protocol file and then control with one was used by writing   getFrequency$(TEST=)   in the DB file and setting   TEST=Test   with dbLoadRecords() 

To enable support for the echo driver in a Makefile:
* Add  asynEcho  to $(APPNAME)_LIBS
* Add  drvAsynEcho.dbd  to $(APPNAME)_DBD

And then in st.cmd use e.g.:
`` 
echoDriverInit(“L0”, 0.1, 0, 0)
``
Where L0 is the asyn port name and 0.1 is, in this case, how long to take to return a reply. The other options allow selecting noautoconnect or multi-device if required
