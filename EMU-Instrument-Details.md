This page collects information that will be useful for the implementation of the IBEX control system on EMU.
## Background & Timeline ##
EMU is a new 96-detector muon spin rotation spectrometer which is optimised for zero field and longitudinal field measurements at ISIS, on TS1. The [EMU](https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/EMU.aspx) web page describes the background to the instrument.

## Control System ##
EMU will migrate from the SECI control system to the IBEX control system in MMMMMMMM YYYY.

## EMU Equipment ##
The equipment listed below is used on EMU. Please add new information (e.g. new items of equipment, new notes, information about drivers, etc. to this table).

##### Note: LakeShore #####
1. On muon instruments, the Triton fridges have an additional Lakeshore controller (the 372) to allow control and continuous readout of the sample temperature (the OI software doesnâ€™t allow this using the in-built Lakeshore, despite the unit having a dedicated channel for the sample thermometry).

##### Note: Aeroflex/IFR #####
Aeroflex has been through a complicated series of sales in recent years.  The Aeroflex manuals (\\\isis\shares\ISIS_Experiment_Controls\AeroflexIFR 2023A) are probably a good place to start, along with any existing VIs.  See also [IFR 2023A](https://www.atecorp.com/products/ifr/2023a).

There appears to be no driver for the Aeroflex 2023A in `C:\LabVIEW Modules\`.  However, there is a driver for an Aeroflex 2030 in `C:\LabVIEW Modules\Drivers\Aeroflex 2030`.

### Booster heater issues

Scientists initially raised concerns about intermittent invalid alarms and it appears this is due to communication failures to a mercury (see [#6286](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/issues/6286)).

These intermittent caused a failure to switch on the booster heater. The reason for this was that the booster heater script refers to the `Temp_Sample` block for determining whether it should switch the heater on, and if the target temperature is higher than `Temp_Sample`, it will start using the booster heater by csetting the same block. If the block is temporarily in â€˜invalidâ€™, then it certainly fails to read and set the temperature (and just carries on).

[#6286](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/issues/6286) was then closed with a temporary increased stream device lock timeout - from 5 to 30 seconds.

The problems fromÂ [#6286](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/issues/6286)Â then reoccurred on the 22nd and 23rd of May 2021, which spawned tickets [#6270](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/issues/6720) (issues concerning communicating with the mercury) and [#6271](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/issues/6721) (issues concerning the booster heater). In [#6270](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/issues/6720), there was some debate over whether there were differences in the mercury's setup on the day (some addresses of the daughter boards were changed) which could have caused the recurrence of the issue.

Investigation showed the device failed to reply as fast in busy periods and didn't reply as quickly as usual, and that a reply timeout trips up the IOC until it gets time to send the commands again and get a correct response. It was suggested that increasing the reply timeout slightly would fix this, but also that it was pertinent to investigate why on the 23rd and 22nd of May this was more prominent. Adding `@replyTimeout`Â handlers didn't seem to help very much either.

Some possible solutions considered:

- Match the way LabVIEW comms are done
- Increase the reply timeout

Sep 2021: Added a [retry mechanism](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/EPICS-StreamDevice/compare/master...Ticket6720_add_max_retries_for_mercury_issues) for protocols. 
Lacking documentation about whether this deployment to EMU was successful, and how above changes have affected the status of [#6271](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/issues/6721).
