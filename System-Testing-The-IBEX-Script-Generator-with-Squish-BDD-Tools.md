# Overview

Behaviour-Driven Development (BDD) is a software development process that builds on the lessons learnt from Test-Driven Development (TDD). BDD focuses on developing a common understanding of the behaviour of an application. More details can be found at https://cucumber.io/docs/bdd/ and https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/bdd/.

BDD works by taking requirements and user stories and describing them in a language that can be understood by developers and users, the Gherkin language https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/reference/. This language helps to accurately describe behaviour and provides a way to carefully consider what to build. Gherkin is most effective for designing software when combined with other techniques such as low-fidelity prototypes.
