To find DLL dependencies of an IOC do the following:
* Open EPICS terminal (`cmd` with `config_env.bat` run)
* cd to iocBoot area of IOC (where its st.cmd is)
* type `depends` - this will set PATHS for this IOC and launch a GUI window
* Now use File -> open and browse to the IOC exe file in the bin directory a couple of levels above
* Now wait...
