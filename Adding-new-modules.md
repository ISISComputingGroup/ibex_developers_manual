First create a new GitHub repository - all EPICS modules should have an "EPICS-" prefix. Use the "new repository" button on https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup but make sure you create a blank repository i.e. without a README, licence or .gitignore file     decide on public or private repository, if you create it privaste you can easily make it public later, but there is a limit on how many pivate repositories we can have at any one time

Go into "add teams and collaborators" and add the ICP-Write group to write access to the repository
