The Keithley 2001 is a digital multimeter. 


The IOC support for the Keithley 2001 supports only reading DC voltage using the `VOLT:DC` measurement functions. 

If one channel is activated

The IRIS OPI and IOC macros are configured to only allow the user to activate channels 1,2,3,4,6,7,8,9.

## Troubleshooting

If there are any problems, restarting the IOC should reset the Keithley 2001 to a set of default settings.
