## Welcome!

This page is designed to be used as a comprehensive reference to getting started in the Instrument Controls team. Written by new starters, for new starters. It's a collection of useful resources which will speed up your onboarding and get you developing. 

## Using the Developer Wiki

There are many how-to guides in this developer Wiki. If you're searching for a particular nugget of information and there doesn't seem to be any information on it, double check results in the 'Wikis' tab:
