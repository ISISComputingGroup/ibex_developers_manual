# Previous Sprint
- Automation: we now have it on the sprint board, with labels being added/removed when moving a card through columns
- Ruff/Pyright day: we did this.
- Using task table instead of task board: this seems to work quite well
- Was remarked last retro that there felt like fewer calls for lat cycle, however after doing the math it was also our most support-heavy cycle of the year

# Current Sprint
## Moving planning meetings later in the day
- Initial proposal was to move them from 10-12 to 10:30-12:30
  - This however cuts into lunch hours, meaning that those who arrive early will have to wait even longer to eat and go hungry for a bit.
  - Additionally can cause issues with people putting meeting early afternoon in diaries which might altogether remove your lunch break
- Balance is people starting early and needing to eat vs needing to travel in in the mornings later to avoid paying for peak tickets
- JD suggestion: what is stopping us from moving to an afternoon meeting?
  - This technically goes against agile methodology (theoretically no work going on between review and planning, in practice that never happens)
  - However we're not held to agile irrevocably, so why not?
  - There used to be a lot of post-planning work, but not any more
  - Could lead to there being many meetings on a single day when in-cycle which is bad for support
- Going to try it as an afternoon meeting for the next few months

## Using Gitlab for instrument config branches
- Won't let us use it due to bad commits
- would have to rewrite history on 4 instrument branches (thankfully not on any others)
- LJ willing to take a look

## ISIS Branded merch for new starters
- JH Hopefully getting around to it this week

## NDX security
- GR highlighted the fragility of the security on NDX machines in the teams channel
   - default user/pass was found on web search
- Bigger problem than was highlighted in the message
- going to revisit with GR present to make sure no points misrepresented

## Cabin PC passwords
-
