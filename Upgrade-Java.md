When Java needs to be updated on the instrument:

1. Before you start, ensure you understand [Java's licensing](Understanding-Java-Licensing).
1. Determine which new version of Java should be installed.
1. Download that version (it has been tested with this version not the latest version) from
    http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/archive-139210.html
1. Double click the installer and accept all defaults.
1. It is possible that upgrading Java will reset the Java Auto Update setting.  Therefore, each time you perform an upgrade, open the Java Control panel and make sure that [Java Auto Update](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml#sched) is disabled (i.e. make sure the "Check for Updates Automatically" checkbox is unchecked).
1. Make sure you run the instrument, either now or before you finish, so that any firewall question can be resolved as yes allow through the firewall.
