# Gotchas

- Scans very (very) slowly. 
- Occasionally device will ignore first character of command, e.g.

```
2018/05/16 16:57:02.169 \\.\COM2 write 3
R9\r
2018/05/16 16:57:02.190 \\.\COM2 read 3
?9\r
2018/05/16 16:57:02.189831 L0 TE:NDW1799:ITC503_01:I: Input "?9" mismatch after 0 bytes
2018/05/16 16:57:02.189842 L0 TE:NDW1799:ITC503_01:I: got "?9" where "R" was expected
```

Usually it should reply with something like `R+5.000` to that command. The `?9` response suggests that the device has dropped the first character. I tried various things to get this to work but it is just a fail on the device's part.
