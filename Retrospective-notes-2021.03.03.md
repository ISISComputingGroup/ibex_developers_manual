### Items from last retrospective

* Monday reviews are still working well
* We're better at being stricter for high/medium/low
* We have now set general meetings to have alternative hosts
* When systems tickets get added to review (mostly by CMS then they will be pointed based on expected review time)
* Release notes PR system is still well liked
* Games on Friday coffee has attracted more people, which is good

### Items from this retrospective

#### New planning site
* No need to add ticket numbers for each story when pointing
* We should start the session afresh before each planning to stop phantom accounts hanging round
* It's ok not to have don't-knows on the priority points

#### Why are some people quiet in pointing tickets etc
* People have different communication styles
* We should discuss estimates but it might be worth taking less time on wildly different estimates 
* Quieter people tend to be unsure and voting on gut reaction (which is fine) and feel like they learn more after the discussions
* We will try the chair being the first person to input in the discussion of points
* By missing out on the quieter people way may be losing the concept of how complex is it for the average developer

### Adding flash reviews to release notes
* If it's a flash review that needs something in the release notes it's probably not a flash review
* Flash reviews were originally created to be process-light
* We just did a large change in how we did release notes, we should see what users think about this first. Next release we should discuss
* If reviewing a flash review and you think it's very user facing then ask them to put in release notes
* When we do the instrument demos we should ask what people think of the release notes

### Spread of ticket sizes
* Pair programming more would be good, we may be doing less of this remotely but it's still happening
* We could split tickets more but we're pretty good at this
* We should do more splitting up in an ad hoc way rather than up front as developers will know a bit more at that point
* We should encourage newer developers to pick up big tickets too
* We should ask at the end of planning if we have too many big tickets
