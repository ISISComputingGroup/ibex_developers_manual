# The Controller

The Attocube ANC350 Piezo controller is currently supported in IBEX. The controller can be communicated with over USB or over Ethernet. IBEX uses the Ethernet communications.

## Enabling Ethernet

The controller does not come with Ethernet enabled as standard, it must be purchased separately (the hardware is there but the firmware needs it unlocked). Before a new Attocube is installed ensure in good time that the Ethernet control has been purchased. It will either be enabled at the factory or you will be provided a code to enable it. You can enter this code by connecting via USB and using the `daisy` software provided by Attocube on purchase of a controller. This software can also be used to set the IP address and subnet mask. Unfortunately the device uses a static IP, as such you will need to get an IP registered for the hall (talk to Chris about this).

# The Driver
The driver was originally written by [Observatory Sciences](http://www.observatorysciences.co.uk/epics_attocube_downloads.php). It is quite an old style EPICS motor controller but is functional. It communicates with the device using is a relatively simple binary format, documented below:

## The Protocol
This is not meant to be an extensive documentation of the protocol, I merely understood enough to implement a [basic emulator](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/EPICS-DeviceEmulator/tree/master/lewis_emulators/attocube_anc350). Each packet sent between the device and IOC contains a header with the following information:

| Information | Type                      | Description |
|-------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| Length      | 4 byte integer, LSB first | The length of the rest of the packet **Not including these 4 bytes** |
| Opcode      | 4 byte integer, LSB first | The action that the driver wishes to perform 0 for set, 1 for get and 3 for ack |
| Address     | 4 byte integer, LSB first | The memory address to read or write to |
| Index       | 4 byte integer, LSB first | Normally the axis that you're reading/writing to |
| Correlation Number      | 4 byte integer, LSB first | Used to match up the response, the driver will increment this for each packet |

When a set is sent to the controller it will look like:

| Information | Type                      | Description |
|-------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| Header      | As above. | As above. |
| Data | Array of 4 byte integers, LSB first | The data to actually write. |

The response will just be a header with the acknowledgement opcode.

When a get is sent to the controller it will just be a header with the get opcode. The response will be:

| Information | Type                      | Description |
|-------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| Header      | As above. | As above. |
| Reason | 4 byte integer, LSB first | Whether the get was successful, 0 if all ok |
| Data | Array of 4 byte integers, LSB first | The data to read from the specified memory address. |

So an example of communications may be:

To controller: `10 00 00 00 01 00 00 00 15 04 00 00 02 00 00 00 8b 00 00 00`

Reply: `18 00 00 00 03 00 00 00 15 04 00 00 02 00 00 00 8b 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 ca 00 00 00`

Here the IOC is getting the value of memory address `0x0415` on axis 0, which is the position of the axis. It receives a value of 202 steps.

This protocol was reverse engineered from the description [here](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/EPICS-attocubeANC350/blob/master/anc350App/src/ucprotocol.h) which gives a lot more information.

## The Memory Addresses
The general protocol mostly just reads and writes to some memory address. There are too many addresses to list here, instead a good reference is at the end of the [supplied docs](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/EPICS-attocubeANC350/blob/master/docs/ANC350_Developers_Manual.pdf) or in the [code itself](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/EPICS-attocubeANC350/blob/master/anc350App/src/devAnc350.h).
