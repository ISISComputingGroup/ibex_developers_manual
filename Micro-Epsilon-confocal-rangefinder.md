# Micro-epsilon confocal range finder

**IOC Name: MECFRF**

This device is used on CRISP to measure distances. It is an ethernet device. It has an IP address assigned by DHCP, but only after is explicitly told to do so. If the device is power cycled you will need to tell it to reacquire an address.

It streams data continuously rather than having an explicit read command.
