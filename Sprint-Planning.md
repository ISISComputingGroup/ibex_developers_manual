Sprint planning is the meeting where we decide what will appear in next sprint. We do this roughly by looking at tickets selected by the team, choosing their priority, and estimating their size.

### Preparation

1. Announce at stand-up that people should add the proposal label to any tickets that they wish to be discussed in the planning meeting, and move them onto the planning board. These should be tickets that _must_ be in the next sprint, with a maximum of 2 extras per person.
1. Ensure that the proposed tickets are on the planning board
1. Add tickets from the Program Increment board which are planned for this sprint specifically, and other high priority tickets as appropriate
1. Add tickets in ready that have not been started to the `From ready` column in order; the easiest way to do this is to open the tickets in order each in a separate tab then add them sequentially to the column on the planning board
1. Add any impeded tickets to the `From Impeded` column, if there is enough time these can be considered to see if they can be moved forward, just in case we have been unable to do this in stand up meetings recently
1. Create a support ticket based on the contents of the support channel (adding one tally for each thread, and for every multiple of 10 in the comments, so a thread with 23 comments would get 3 tally marks), and assign it to ISIS Builder with the appropriate number of points
1. Remove the automation from the `Review Complete` column of the IBEX board, rename that column to be the name of the sprint ending
1. Create a new `Review Complete` column which is automated to the `Done` type based on the closing of a ticket

### During meeting

1. Check the program increment board, and briefly discuss any reasons for any items being carried over if there are many of them.
1. For each ticket in proposed (this should be kept to a maximum of 5 minutes per ticket if possible):
    1. Read the ticket and understand the issue
    1. Make sure the acceptance criteria makes sense
    1. Select the priority of the ticket high/medium/low and move to that column
    1. Estimate the ticket using planning poker site; there is no need if it is already pointed
1. Consider the `From Ready` tickets, and add them to the appropriate priority column
1. Order the columns

### After the meeting

1. Remove any tickets in the `Ready` column of the IBEX project board that are not reworks
1. Add the tickets from the planning board in order from the top of High to the end of Low
1. Set the milestones of tickets to the appropriate milestone
1. Empty the planning board, and make sure to remove the proposal label from all tickets
