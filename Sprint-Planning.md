Sprint planning is the meeting where we decide what will appear in next sprint. We assign these roughly to high/medium/low priority tickets, and give them a `points` value to indicate a rough estimate of effort involved in those items. This is all done through the current Program Increment (PI) project on GitHub.

### Preparation

All team members should add the proposal label to tickets that should be considered whenever they are aware of this. These will automatically be added to the appropriate Program Increment project in GitHub.
The project manager (or an agreed alternative team member) should do the following prior to the meeting, either late the day before, or the morning of the meeting:
1. Ensure that all proposed items are in the appropriate `Sprint`, most easily done on the `PI Summary` tab.
1. On the `Breakdown by Sprint` board, check the items in the `No Sprint` column to see if they should be assigned to the next sprint - these are in priority order for the PI.
1. Update the `Planning Board` and `Planning Table` tabs to filter on the Sprint to be planned.
1. Any items from the current sprint in the backlog, but without a rework label, are assigned to the Sprint to be planned.
1. Create a support ticket based on the contents of the support channel (adding one tally for each thread, and for every multiple of 10 in the comments, so a thread with 23 comments would get 3 tally marks), and assign it to ISIS Builder with the appropriate number of points
1. Remove the automation from the `Review Complete` column of the IBEX board, rename that column to be the name of the sprint ending
1. Create a new `Review Complete` column which is automated to the `Done` type based on the closing of a ticket

### During meeting
1. Post a link to the planning poker site and a reminder of the points estimates to the chat in zoom. This information is available in the `Planning` tab on the IBEX Developers MS Teams `announce` channel.
1. For each ticket in proposed (this should be kept to a maximum of 5 minutes per ticket if possible):
    1. Read the ticket and understand the issue
    1. Make sure the acceptance criteria makes sense
    1. Select the priority of the ticket high/medium/low and move to that column
    1. If a ticket is to be delayed to a later sprint in this PI, change the assignment of the ticket
    1. If a ticket should be delayed to the next PI, assign it to the appropriate Sprint
    1. If a ticket is put on hold for longer than that, simply remove it from the PI project
    1. Estimate the ticket using planning poker site; there is no need if it is already pointed; Points should be provided as a label at the minimum during the meeting, the field in the project is not in use as of May 2024 when this was updated

### After the meeting

1. Check with Kathryn, this process is currently being updated.
