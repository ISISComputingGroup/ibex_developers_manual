Sprint planning and pre-planning are the meetings where we decide what will appear in next sprint. We do this roughly by looking at tickets selected by the team choosing there priority and estimating their size. Then taking the most important tickets.

All activates are also done at pre-planning except when marked **[planning]**

### Preparation

1. Announce at stand-up that people should add the proposal label and move on the planning board; tickets should be tickets that must be in and a maximum of 2 extras per person.
1. **[planning only]** Look at any IOC tickets and get someone to do an analysis of the difficulty
1. **[planning only]** Add tickets in ready that have not been started to the "From ready" column in order; the easiest way to do this is to open the tickets in order each in a separate tabs then add then sequentially to the column on the planning board.
1. Also make sure any release ticket need are in (see next section)

#### Releases

1. Check the [milestones](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/milestones) for upcoming releases (also noted in the [Pending Tasks](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/wiki/Pending-Tasks)).
1. Check the dates listed in the milestone description.  Adjust dates, if necessary.
1. Add tickets to Create and Deploy the release.


### During meeting

1. For each ticket in proposed:
    1. Read the ticket and understand the issue
    1. Make sure the acceptance criteria makes sense
    1. Select the priority of the ticket high/medium/low and move to that column
    1. If in high then estimate the ticket using planning poker site; there is no need if it is already pointed
1. Order the High column (in sprint pre-planning if there is not time to do that don't worry)
    1. **[planning only]** Include tickets from column "From ready"; usually start with these
1. **[planning only]** Get the estimate for the work we can do and count down that number of tickets

### After the meeting

1. Remove tickets that did not make the sprint from ready (label and column)
1. Remove tickets from the bucket (label and column)
1. For tickets that made it to the sprint
    1. Set all tickets milestones on new tickets.
    1. Set label from proposal to ready and add to ready column in correct order
1. For tickets that weren't in sprint take top # and add to bucket
1. Remove all proposal labels (and tickets from planning board)
