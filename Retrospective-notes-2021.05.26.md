### Previous retrospective notes discussion

* Happy to keep burndown chart calculation as is.  i.e. begin with estimate of capacity covering all projects

* Technical Articles meeting arranged and suggestions for books etc. requested.

* Zero points possible for support tasks, if only few minutes spent.  Suggestion to count and categorize posts in "support-issues" channel to spot patterns.  Agreed to discuss before next cycle at end of long shutdown.

* Split of review and retrospective meetings: most people accept.  Agreed to alter order of meetings and having on separate days i.e. review Tuesday, retrospective Wednesday, planning Thursday.  Will have think about how it could work during next sprint, but not change anything, and try in practice next cycle.

* Variable sprint lengths also accepted by most, as long as not too long (>6 weeks?).

* "Friday" ticket time: most agreed with KVLB plan to have a week of them every now and again.
