After a release all of the dependencies of the system should be considered for update. This will ensure that we do not get to far our of date and any upgrade will, hopefully, be small and not require much effort. In general we do not want to be on the bleeding edge but at the last stable release so use your judgement. There is a growing dependency list which will get shipped with the release notes and should be kept up-to-date with any notes. This page documents the process of updating and any complexities.
