What to do when you need to fix something on an Instrument or modify code on the instrument.

1. Fix the bug
1. Record the bug as a ticket; with solution done
1. Note the bug next to the instrument on the main IBEX page
1. If the bug is likely to effect other instruments inform the icp team using the group email
1. If the bug will seriously effect instrument scientists consult the PM

This is so we always know what is on any instrument but don't have to create a new release to fix something. Part of the release process is to whip out any changes to an instrument and then put back any noted changed. So if the changes aren't recorded then they will be lost.
