- [genie_python](genie_python): genie_python, scripting language and python framework
- [IBEX Mini-inst Server](Configure-Mini-Inst): The mini-inst is an ibex server which only runs a fixed and small number of IOCs and processes (usually without a block server or archiver)
- [Accelerator Information Forwarder](Beam-Status,-Shutter,-accelerator-and-moderator-information): Forwards information about the state of the accelerator and various other bits of centralised data (moderators, shutters etc) into EPICS for IBEX and SECI.
