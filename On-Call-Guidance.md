All full time members of the ISIS Computing Group are expected to be on the on call rota. Typically this will rotate so that people spend a week on it before passing it on to the next person. The on call number is `x1763` (as called from a RAL phone) and should be available between 7:00-23:00 7 days a week during cycle.

If a scientist/user contacts you directly about an urgent issue, you should politely remind them that this number exists and they will be much more likely to get swifter assistance by calling it rather than individuals (obviously after you have fixed the issue).

If you get called with an issue that you believe has the potential to stop all instruments taking data (e.g. the central beam status is reporting incorrectly or there is a critical bug in a core IBEX component) you should immediately email all instrument scientists using the `ISIS Instrument Scientist` mailing list. You should make them aware of the problem and any workarounds that you have found.

If you are on call at a weekend you should look at the [nagios overview](https://varanus.nd.rl.ac.uk/nagios/) and the [web dashboard overview](http://dataweb.isis.rl.ac.uk/IbexDataweb/Overview/ibexOverview.html) in the morning to check the status of the instruments as we would normally during stand up. At the same time you should also check that no urgent issues have come through to the Experiment Controls inbox.

If you encounter an urgent problem that you are really unsure of you can find other team member's numbers in the support phone's contacts list or at `\\isis\shares\ISIS_Experiment_Controls\On Call\Phone Numbers.xlsx`.

## Finding telephone numbers for instrument scientists and instruments

To find contact numbers for instrument scientists and cabin phone numbers for instruments, the following website is available: [Instrument Map](https://www.isis.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/Instruments.aspx). On this page you can either click on the instrument (in the top image), or click the `Contacts And Support > Instrument Scientists` tab and find the instrument you are looking for.
