All full time members of the ISIS Computing Group are expected to be on the on call rota. Typically this will rotate so that people spend a week on it before passing it on to the next person. The on call number is `x1763` (as called from a RAL phone) and should be available between 7:00-23:00 7 days a week during cycle.

If a scientist/user contacts you directly about an urgent issue, you should politely remind them that this number exists and they will be much more likely to get swifter assistance by calling it rather than individuals (obviously after you have fixed the issue).

If you get called with an issue that you believe has the potential to stop all instruments taking data (e.g. the central beam status is reporting incorrectly or there is a critical bug in a core IBEX component) you should immediately email all instrument scientists using the `ISIS Instrument Scientist` mailing list. You should make them aware of the problem and any workarounds that you have found.
