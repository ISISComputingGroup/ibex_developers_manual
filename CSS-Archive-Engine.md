# Archive Engine

The Archive Engine is part of CSS and is used to archive PV values, the manual for which is [here](http://cs-studio.sourceforge.net/docbook/ch11.html). Note that most facilities use the [Archive Appliance](https://slacmshankar.github.io/epicsarchiver_docs/index.html) as the Archive Engine (specifically MySQL) was found to be slow at millions of PVs. As we don't have that many PVs we have continued to use the Archive Engine.

The code for the Archive Engine is [here](https://github.com/ControlSystemStudio/cs-studio/tree/master/applications/archive). We have our own fork of this [here](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/cs-studio) but in general the two should be in sync as much as possible as [discussed](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/ibex_developers_manual/wiki/GUI-CSS#source-code).

We have a built version of the ArchiveEngine at `\\shadow.isis.cclrc.ac.uk\ICP_Binaries$\CSS` which gets copied into `EPICS\CSS\master\css-win.x86_64` during the build. The built version is manually updated to keep it in line with the cs-studio version, see [updating the archive engine](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/ibex_developers_manual/wiki/CSS-Archive-Engine#updating-the-archive-engine).

We actually run two archive engines on each instrument:

1. Block archive, this just archives blocks and is restarted whenever the configuration (and blocks) change.
1. Instrument archive, this is just started once and archives all PVs marked with the archive info setting which are in the database. See [configuration](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/ibex_developers_manual/wiki/CSS-Archive-Engine#configuration).

To run these archive engines there are two batch files in `EPICS\CSS\master\ArchiveEngine` called `start_block_archiver` and `start_inst_archiver`. They can also both be accessed via procserv as **ARBLOCK** and **ARINST**.

Each Archive Engine can be accessed via a web browser when running. This is what the [web dashboard](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/ibex_developers_manual/wiki/Web-Dashboard) is based on.

## Prerequisites

The archive engine stores values in a MySQL database. To set the database up see [here](Installing-and-Upgrading-MySQL).

Create the database using the mysql_schema.txt in `...EPICS\CSS\master\ArchiveEngine` which originates from `org.csstudio.archive.rdb\dbd`

## Configuration

To change properties of the archive engine in general such as which database it is pointing to and the channel access settings you can modify `mysql_settings_*.ini` in `EPICS\CSS\master\ArchiveEngine`.

The archive engine gets its configuration for what PVs to archive and how (i.e. frequency or monitoring) from the same database that it archives values to. Rather than editing this directly the easiest way to modify it is using the [Archive Configuration Tool](http://cs-studio.sourceforge.net/docbook/ch11.html#idm140164570515184). 

Various examples of the xml format used for the tool are in `EPICS\CSS\master\ArchiveEngine`. They can be manually imported/exported using the get/set batch scripts in `EPICS\CSS\master\ArchiveEngine`. The way this xml is created differs for the instrument and block archivers:

### Instrument Archive

For setting which PVs to archive you can add an info field into the relevant db. For example `info(archive, "0.1 VAL")` will archive the VAL field every 0.1 seconds. When the IOC is first started this info field data gets put into the ioc [database](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/ibex_developers_manual/wiki/Database-Schemas#ioc-database). The `CSS\master\ArchiveEngine\make_archive_xml.py` script then converts this into xml for the Archive Config Tool to put into the archive engine database.

### Block Archive

The configuration for logging blocks is created and set by the [Blockserver](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/ibex_developers_manual/wiki/BlockServer).

# Updating the Archive Engine

As our version of the Archive Engine is no different to CSS we can just copy their builds to get the latest version. To do this:

1. Download the build from [CSS](https://ics-web.sns.ornl.gov/css/updates/apps/). 
1. Place it in a folder called `css_archvive_engine`
1. Zip the folder and call it `css_archive_engine-win.x86_64.zip`
1. Copy this to ICP Binaries on to internal server

## Editing the Archive Engine

In some cases we may want to build the archive engine ourselves. For example, if we want to edit the code. To do this:

1. Clone the repository from https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/cs-studio
1. In Eclipse `Import->General->Projects from Folder or Archive` and import the `cs-studio\applications\archive` directory. It may prompt you to install some tycho plug ins and restart eclipse.
1. Create a target platform and add the latest CSS version specified [here](http://controlsystemstudio.org/controlsystemstudio/current.html) as a 


In Eclipse, go to org.csstudio.archive.engine and open `ArchiveEngine.product`.

Add the following settings to the "Launching" tab under "Program Arguments" and run as a normal RCP application:

```
    -engine my_engine -pluginCustomization full_path_here\my_settings.ini
```

The CS-Studio manual says that the port is required for consistency tests but I have found this to cause problems.

Alternatively, leave the "Program Arguments" blank and edit the plugin_customization.ini in the project to contain the settings.

If creating a standalone executable, leave "Program Arguments" blank and use command line arguments instead. 

By using the MySQL command line it should be possible to see the database filling up (it appears the update rate is ~30 seconds, so you might  not see any changes initially).

```
    mysql> use archive;
    mysql> select * from sample;
```
