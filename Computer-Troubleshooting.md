Issue related to the computer that IBEX is running on


## Screen Resolution needs to be Set on a small screen to view a larger screen remotely

The resolution is settable on a remote desktop, even to a resolution bigger than the current screen. To do this there is a menu item on the remote desktop window for “smart sizing” which does just this. 

![smart screen](troubleshooting/rdp_smart_screen.png)

It doesn't seem to persist on server 2012 unless you edit it into the `.rdp` file (and it also requires that you don’t select full screen or it takes a lower resolution).  I’ve edited the `.rdp` file appropriately on the NDHSMUONFE desktop so that this works at 1920x1200.  The key bits are at the top here – but you we can fiddle the resolution down a bit if a different aspect ratio works better.

```
screen mode id:i:1
use multimon:i:0
desktopwidth:i:1920
desktopheight:i:1200
smartsizing:i:1
...
```

## Cannot access the network shares

This may be solved by adding windows credentials on the machine. There is a document describing how to do this on ICP Discussions under "Security".

## Cannot access just the ISIS archive (but can access the instrument shares as above)

This will be identified by a failure to access archive shares even though access to the normal ISIS document shares **is** possible
This may be solved by adding a global DNS suffix to the network connection. Open an admin privileged powershell console.  Then use the get command to check what is in the existing suffix list

```
Get-DnsClientGlobalSetting

UseSuffixSearchList : True
SuffixSearchList    : {domain1.ac.uk, domain2.ac.uk}
UseDevolution       : True
DevolutionLevel     : 0
```

Now run the following command to prepend the fully qualified (in our case the ISIS domain) to the suffix search list returned in the last command (similar syntax to the example below).

`PS C:\> Set-DnsClientGlobalSetting -SuffixSearchList newdomain3.ac.uk,domain1.ac.uk,domain2.ac.uk`

## Cannot VNC into the machine

Check the network is up (ping `NDX<INST>`).

If it is, check the VNC process is running on the NDX machine (there should be a VNC icon in the task bar). 
If not start it by double-clicking the entry in the windows autostart menu (`c:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\StartUp`) and start it manually. VNC does not run as a windows service on NDX computers - it is running in "user mode" in the background, started on login

## Data fills up volume too rapidly on an Instrument
  (generating Nagios errors or disk full errors)

This is usually an issue when an instrument changes their mode of data taking and it is particularly common for instruments which have changed recently to using event mode data collection or altered the scheme they use (where the amount of data which can be produced may be much larger).
Good questions to ask are:

  1) Are any monitors being used in event mode (usually not a good idea, better to histogram)
  2) Have the jaws been opened up or is white beam falling on any detectors (check setup with scientist)
  3) Any unusually rapid data taking? (e.g. 15s runs with large-ish files)

## Data Disk available space

Varies widely per instrument and the space is tailored over time to match the needs of the instrument (with spare space as a buffer against exceptional usage).

Space for data to reside on the instrument so it can be analysed locally is provided by a cache which is purged on most instruments using a scheduled task with `robocopy` (`robocopy /? `for details).  Cache sizes vary widely per instrument.  Some instruments with low data rates have caches with more gentle purging strategies.  Caching on most high volume instruments will use a `robocopy` task with the MINAGE parameter set to 1 or 2 remove files that are 1 or 2 days old.  Fewer instruments purge on a monthly basis (e.g. MINAGE:30), muons and reflectometers generally have smaller data files.

Availability in the cache for 1 day minimum is required for local copying programs on all instruments to have data _available for copying_ from the instrument `data` share.  The External Export cache may be cleared of recent data files if space is limited, but NOT the instrument Data area (these will be removed only when archived).

The Clean and purging tasks run as privileged tasks in the scheduled tasks library on the guest VMs.  Where specially large and controlled caching is needed (on WISH currently) a more generic powershell script `purge.ps1` is run as a task on the host - the difference being that the cache trims to a fill level of over 90% on age and currently will not empty over time.  This allows maximum local data (about 2 cycles normally) to be available for local analysis.  In both cases, files are first moved to an area for deletion and then deleted by a separate task which runs later.

## System Disk Getting Full; Finding Space

Often the system disk gets full because of logging, or windows updates etc. You can free up space by doing the following:

- VNC to machine, check no-one is using it
- Run `Tree Size` and analyse the C drive:
    - Flag any large files that you are worried about deleting to Chris
    - Check size of `instrument/var/logs` move any large logs to back `<inst area>\Backups$\stage-deleted\<instrument>`. Do this by creating a directory on c, moving files in then copying to this because it is write once. 
- Uninstall apps which shouldn't be there (if you have admin access then removing mysql installer - community save 600Mb)
- [Truncate the database if it is too large](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/ibex_developers_manual/wiki/Database-Troubleshooting#reducing-database-disc-space)
- If you have remote desktop and a little more time then:
    - Run `Disk Clean-Up` on C in user mode and remove all default files
    - Run it in admin mode by clicking the button
    - Remove all the default files it lets you

## Getting 1920 x 1200 (or other) resolution on Daxten (analogue) connection to a monitor which supports this

Dual monitors with one replicated by a Daxten or a single remote Daxten monitor may need this as 1920 x 1200 monitors are less common in default resolution lists.  Digital connections are normally fine but in this case the connection has to be analogue.

When a monitor is being driven though a remote analogue VGA connection, there is no feedback to the computer to select the correct monitor resolution.  In this case the resolution must be forced on the graphics card and in Windows to be correct.  The essentials are
  1) install the analogue _monitor_ driver in the advanced display settings for the screen - once this is associated with the dispaly...
  2) Use the Graphics card Manufacturer utility to set up a custom 1920 x 1200 resolution (if necessary) and refresh rate (go low on refresh rate e.g. 51Hz if the graphics card considers the refresh rate too high).
  3) Ensure this is applied to the correct display.
