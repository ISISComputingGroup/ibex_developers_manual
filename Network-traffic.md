To see packets to and from the machine simply install wireshark and use. To look at packets on localhost. Install npcap (https://nmap.org/npcap/) with compatible for winpcap. Then afterwards install wireshark it should recognise ncap.

1. Start Wireshark
1. Select capture interface (for localhost use Npcap Loopback Adapter)

    - `(data.data contains "TE:NDW1407:CS:SB" || data.data contains 00:06:00:08)` look at all packets containing block on my machine or the EPICS search for channel messsage
    - `udp.dstport == 55691 || udp.srcport == 55691` get all UDP data from and to port 55691
    - `tcp.srcport == 51679` get all tcp data from port 51679

    netstat -abon
