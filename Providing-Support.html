<h1>Providing Support<a class="headerlink" href="#providing-support" title="Link to this heading"></a></h1>
<p>There is a long list of things to worry about when you have the support phone or are dealing with a support issue, and this page should provide a starting point to look for guidance on what to do if no one is around.</p>
<p>These pages should be a living document - as people learn things add them to the appropriate place if things change, and you notice, update them. If you are experienced, make sure the rest of us are getting things right and verify what is linked to from here. Just remember, this is a public wiki, so be wary of the detail added.</p>
<p>Don’t forget to “Send As” ISIS Experiment Controls in outlook and also cc: ISIS Experiment Controls in the message, that way it will be possible for others to see what has already been discussed. Don’t forget to include your name when signing off emails from ISIS Experiment Controls, it’s much nicer to deal with a person who is part of a group than an anonymous entity.</p>
<p>Everyone should start a thread in the “support issues” teams channel for any support work whether that is the emails being dealt with, the calls received, or anything that comes out of people walking into the office.</p>
<p>If remote, make sure you are either on the VPN or accessing a system on-site in some way.</p>
<p>The on call number is <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">x1763</span></code> (as called from a RAL phone, and should be available between 7:00-23:00 7 days a week during cycle.
The email address can be found in the address book as <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ISIS</span> <span class="pre">Experiment</span> <span class="pre">Controls</span></code>.</p>

<h2>The types of support<a class="headerlink" href="#the-types-of-support" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>All permanent members of the ISIS Computing Group are expected to be on the support rotas.</p>
<p>Note that being the person on rota means you are responsible for seeing that support items are dealt with. This doesn’t mean you have to do them, but you have to make sure they are done.</p>
<p>There is no requirement to change working patterns when on call.</p>
<section id="some-basic-support-principles">
<h3>Some basic support principles<a class="headerlink" href="#some-basic-support-principles" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>If a scientist/user contacts you directly about an urgent issue, you should politely remind them that there is an on call number, and a generic email, and they will be much more likely to get swifter assistance by calling/emailing it rather than individuals.</p>
<p>If you are working on a problem that you believe has the potential to stop all instruments taking data (e.g. the central beam status is reporting incorrectly or there is a critical bug in a core IBEX component) you should immediately email all instrument scientists using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">ISIS</span> <span class="pre">Instrument</span> <span class="pre">Scientist</span></code> mailing list. You should make them aware of the problem and any workarounds that you have found.</p>
<p>If you encounter an urgent problem that you are really unsure of you can find other team member’s numbers in the support phone’s contacts list or at <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">\\isis\shares\ISIS_Experiment_Controls\On</span> <span class="pre">Call\Phone</span> <span class="pre">Numbers.xlsx</span></code>.</p>

<section id="who-is-on-call-when">
<h3>Who is on call when?<a class="headerlink" href="#who-is-on-call-when" title="Link to this heading"></a></h3>
<p>The “first line” and on call rotas will be made available via the shared calendar as is currently the case.
There will always be someone who is “first line”, but those duties vary in and out of cycle.
On call only exists in cycle.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="duties-for-first-line">
<h2>Duties for first line<a class="headerlink" href="#duties-for-first-line" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>This role is active between 8:30 and 17:00, every weekday, generally with a different person on duty each week.
You will keep an eye on the support emails, and any voicemails, and make sure they are dealt with by someone. Chase up if something doesn’t happen.
If you don’t have the experience to resolve something, then you should ask the team for help.</p>
<p>Your phone will ring first for support issues, be prepared to answer it.</p>
<p>If you don’t have the experience to resolve the issues, then in cycle you should ask whoever is on call for help first, followed by others in the team. Out of cycle ask the team.</p>
<p>Extra note for the first week of cycle, these are usually busy, be prepared to delegate tasks. It may be necessary to ask specific individuals to undertake tasks, and you may need to keep track of who is dealing with which problem and where they are. It would also be wise to share the issues as appropriate, but do remember that working patterns and individual needs may play a part in who can help with what.</p>
</section>
<section id="what-does-being-on-call-mean">
<h2>What does being on call mean?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-does-being-on-call-mean" title="Link to this heading"></a></h2>
<p>This role is active between 07:00 and 23:00, everyday in cycle, generally with a different person on duty each week.</p>
<p>An on call week starts on a Friday and finishes a week later. (So that the first on call week of a cycle starts the Friday before cycle starts, and the final on call week ends with cycle.)</p>
<p>During working hours the person scheduled for first line will receive phone calls first, therefore the duties here are more focussed on the out of hours time (07:00 to 08:30 and 17:00 to 23:00).</p>
<p>Your mobile phone will ring, be prepared to answer it, and deal with the issue detailed.</p>
<p>If the person on first line support is inexperienced, be ready to support them and take calls from them.</p>

<details>
  <summary> Steps to answer the phone. </summary>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Greet the caller with something that tells them they are talking to the right team, e.g. just respond with “ISIS Experiment Controls Support”</p></li>
<li><p>Make a note* of the time</p></li>
<li><p>Make a note* of the name of the instrument and the name or at least the role of the caller, if possible - sometimes they are quick and you don’t get to catch it, or they don’t actually say who it is. These calls can also come from visiting users in cabins, or from the Main Control Room (MCR), knowing who called you about the problem can help if others need to follow it up. Check how best to call them back - scientist may call from cabin, but say to email or phone back on their mobile in case they are no longer in the cabin.</p></li>
<li><p>Make a note* of the basic problem. Useful details like:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>When did the problem start happening (this helps us to know where to look for in log files)</p></li>
<li><p>Is it happening now, or only when you try and do something</p></li>
<li><p>What events led up to the problem happening e.g. which commands, opened something on GUI, connected new equipment, …</p></li>
<li><p>how urgent is it - do they have a workaround for now etc.  When is a convenient time for us to start to investigate issue.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>If you can solve the problem do so, if you can’t start finding the appropriate answers in this guide or by reaching out to others (if onsite, ask in office - if offsite, post in teams). It is OK to tell the user you will call them back</p></li>
</ol>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Notes can be mental notes - but don’t be afraid to write everything down either, you have to write it all down for the out of hours calls anyway.</p></li>
