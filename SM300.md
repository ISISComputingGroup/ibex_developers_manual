The SM300 is a controller which moves to the position of motors simultaneously. So you set the position for each axis and then tell it to move to those positions. 


## Known Issues

The driver will do go to X and Y at the same time because of the motor record. Once a position is set on X both motors will start to move to their positions but motor Y will not actually move. If a position is then set on motor Y it is already in a moving state so the motor record will not issue a new move command (I think because it dose not have a direction yet). If you change the direction of the X then the Y motor will get the new direction and both motors will now move simulateously. (At least in the simulator I will try on the device and confirm).
