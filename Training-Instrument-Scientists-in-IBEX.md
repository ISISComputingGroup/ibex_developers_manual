The plan is to run regular instrument scientist training courses so that they can become familiar with IBEX. Often the course will be before we migrate instruments to IBEX. The process is below the steps are not necessarily in order:

1. Check for general training tickets on the backlog. They may suggest people who need to be invited and alterations to training material that need to be made.
1. Contact instrument scientists with an invite with a suggested date. The email I sent last was

>Hi **XXX, XXX, XXX**
>    
> As you know we are migrating or have migrated your instruments to IBEX. To help you use the new system we would like to invite you to some training with IBEX. If you would like to come can you suggest some dates when you are free; maybe something in the week of the **XXXXX**. If there is anyone else you think should come please let me know so I can invite them too.
>  
> In similar sessions we have had a hands on tour of IBEX using simulated instruments with slides The session can be tailored to your needs and we can spend more or less time on each part. Last time it took a couple of hours to run the session. The summary from last time was:
>    1.	General Introduction
>    2.	IBEX
>
>         a. Main
>         b. Dashboard
>         c. Blocks
>         d. System views (Alarm, DAE, Device Screens, Experiment Details, Logs, Log Plotter, Motors, Synoptics)
>    3.	Configurations
>    4.	Scripting
>    
> I have attached the slides that we used last time. They are no longer completely accurate and will be updated to reflect the improvements we have made in IBEX. 
>    
> The other option is to give you early access to the simulated instruments so that you can try out things before you come 
    and use it more as a Q&A session; let me know if you would prefer this.
>    
> If you have any question please donâ€™t hesitate to ask otherwise please let me know of dates that would be good.
>    
> Cheers,

1. Wait for replies then organise a calendar invite
    1. I have booked 3hrs in total usually in CR21 or CR25
    1. Try to book the room 15 minutes beforhand to setup.
1. Organise laptops from facilities
1. Update the training material (link on [links and resources](links-and-resources))
1. Create a number of VMs with IBEX installed for scientists to play with

During the talk make sure the talking is shared so it is clear it is a group that is supporting the application.
