# Dashboard

The IBEX dashboard provides a summary of the status of the instrument; in particular the DAE.

### Customization

The data displayed in the dashboard can be customized by modifying the database in: 

```
C:\instrument\settings\config\<machine name>\configurations\dashboard.db
```

This is loaded by the `INSTETC` IOC.

There are two example files for neutron and muon instruments in the following location. By default, the neutron one will be copied in by the upgrade script. On a muon instrument, you will need to (manually) copy in the muon-specific DB.

```
C:\Instrument\Apps\EPICS\misc\upgrade\master\data\dashboard.db
C:\Instrument\Apps\EPICS\misc\upgrade\master\data\dashboard_muon.db
```

The dashboards points at PVs prefixed with `%MYPVPREFIX:CS:DASHBOARD:` and postfixed with either `VALUE` or `LABEL` to get the values of the value or label respectively. The data type of these PVs must be strings, and they must therefore be less than 40 characters long. **To be visible in the web dashboard, they must additionally be archived using `info(archive, "VAL")`**.

Examples:
```
caget %MYPVPREFIX%CS:DASHBOARD:BANNER:LEFT:LABEL
caget %MYPVPREFIX%CS:DASHBOARD:TAB:2:2:VALUE
```

The following picture shows the location of each customizable dashboard PV (each one includes both a value and a label).
