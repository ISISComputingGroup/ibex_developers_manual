These are controlled by the `SCHNDR` iocs and are used on various instruments, such as to monitor value status or pressure (a TPG300 can for example feed data into the PLC inputs). Relevant macros are:

* `MODE`: `TCP`, `RTU` or `ASCII` to specify PLC connection mode. We generally use either `TCP` or `RTU`.
* `PORT`: Serial COM Port of PLC for `RTU` or `ASCII` mode
* `IPADDR`: IP address of PLC for `TCP` mode
* `IPPORT`: TCP will connect on default modbus 502 port, set this if different.

To configure EPICS records for PLC specific variables, set macros such as `DEVCMD1` to a CMD file base name in the `devices` subdirectory which should be loaded. For example on GEM we set `DEVCMD1` to `GEMGateValve` to load `devices/GEMGateValve.cmd`. Currently there is only `DEVCMD1` but if there were cross instrument files that were useful to load, or a plc talked to multiple separate devices, then adding `DEVCMD2` may be useful in future
