## Previous retrospective notes

* Try recording code chat in upcoming code chat
* Mantid has a week after release to tidy up - Not necessary for us as because of our development management style
* Only run system tests locally if you think it will break the system
* Instrument demo page - One page with headers for each release instead of one per demo meeting.
* Sprint 2020.08.19 went well 
* Can change stand up order



## Making Review easier

* Suggest classes/files as a starting point
* Leave some tips on reviewing

## Undocumented features

* Document any information/features that you know which could be useful to the team for development/support.

## Hard to keep track of support Email (answered/unanswered)

* Possible to remove fluff?
* 5-6 different email for the same topic which is hard to remember (maybe get in touch with Freddie?)

## Test environment for our product

* Installing and running script generator was fine on dev machine whereas it failed on user's machine. We should always test the installation process in an environment which better represents a user's machine.
* Careful with acceptance criteria

 ## Deciding when to move sprint meetings and prioritise other tasks

* Let others know that you will not be able to attend sprint planning during stand up
* Poll to reschedule sprint meetings
