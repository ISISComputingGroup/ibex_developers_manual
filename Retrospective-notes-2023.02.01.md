## Items from [last retrospective](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/ibex_developers_manual/wiki/Retrospective-notes-2023.01.04):

### 
> Is point allocation for support appropriate?
- Best to apply points earlier in the sprint

###  
> Migrating to new GitHub projects system and separating issues
- Decided _not_ to use GitHub Pages for the moment, but will review at later date

### 
> Coffee
- Too tricky to invite MANTID group to coffee, but possible with accelerator controls group.  FAA talking to Ivan anyway.
