## Previous Retrospective

We should make a ticket to add to the project board checks that notifies us when a ticket has been in review for a week or more. Currently, the project board checks code is not in git.

## The new method of running planning and pre-planning, where we point as we assign to high, seems to cut out a lot of duplicated discussions and lets us have shorter meetings.

Yes, we like this! üëç 

## Could we use the same password for all zoom meetings and have it included in the email?

This issue has been resolved by clicking the link. There are two passwords a numeric for the phone and a regular password.


## Recording Architectural decisions

There was a discussion at the LabVIEW user group meeting today about documentation.  One thing that was recommended as particularly useful by one contributor (and seemed interesting to me) was to keep architectural decision records (ADRs).  We often meet to discuss things and make decisions but don't necessarily formalise the results so they can be tracked and easily located later.  They might also have an audience in our user base and in training for future developers. i.e. why is it done like this?

We have a decision log, which is being used more and more, and it is becoming useful. We should use a more solid template. The link above has some good ideas of how to layout this template.

## Added tickets

John created an added tickets channel. Kevin has already been recording these added tickets. It is useful to be able to track which tickets have been added and why. Therefore we will create a label and people are expected to write on the ticket why it was bought in.

We need to be aware of why we are adding tickets and we should only be doing this in discussion with others (especially those likely to disagree with us).
