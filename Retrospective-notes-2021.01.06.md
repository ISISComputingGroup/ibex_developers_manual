### Items from the retrospective before last
#### Email template
- Still needs to be done, DO added to his list.
#### POLARIS Sample Changer
- DO suggested a reasonable amount of time (~3 days) is required with the device to finish off remaining issues.

### Items from last retrospective
#### Drop-in sessions and the shared/private email discussion
- Initial invitation can be sent from shared ISIS ExptCtrls account.  Select setting to not require response to avoid clutter.
#### Release notes
- New process in place and automation following shortly
#### Presence on site not enough if there are multiple tasks at once
- Plan at moment is to have 2 people on site per day if restrictions allow and demand dictates.  Will wait to see how current situation develops before deciding on strategy and rota.

### Items from this retrospective
- Friday tickets not being reviewed quickly enough, true for general tickets too.  Reviews should take precedence over rework, especially towards end of sprint.
- Suggestion to have Monday morning for reviews to save context switching between consecutive work days.  Developers should at least self-assign tickets to be reviewed at this time.
- Friday "sprint" went well and was enjoyed on the whole.  Other ongoing tasks did get in the way of people taking on a specific Friday ticket.
- Discussion about shorter sprints to concentrate on specific matters (c.f. mantid tidy-up week) "Technical Debt Sprint"?  Decided not realistic in cycle, but more likely in long(er) shutdowns.

### Additional Comments
- Discussion on GitHub price plans followed main meeting
