This is a temporary page for fault finding with changes from https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/issues/4435

symptoms: com port stuck, no reads work, dbior hangs.

Until this PR is deployed you will first need to update asyn.dll for the IOC concerned
* stop IOC concerned
* copy asyn.dll from Ticket4435 build (asyn_ovio jenkins job) to same directory as .exe for IOC (so it will load in preference to existing asyn.dll)
* start IOC
* when done, remove new asyn.dll from the IOC bin/windows-x64 directory

After restarting with new asyn you should be able to type
```
dbior drvAsyn 5
```
without it hanging. The new ASIO may even fix the issue, but should at least give you more output. If the IOC is not fixed, can you try adding:
```
epicsEnvSet("WAITFORBYTES",1)
```
to the st.cmd, this will enable another sort of read mode to test.

It would also be worth adding
```
asynSetOption("L0", -1, "eventmask", "0x11b")	
```
to startup, this will print all com events except writes â€“ to see writes too use:
```
asynSetOption("L0", -1, "eventmask", "0x11f")
```
You can also stop IOC and try using the testSerialPort command https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/ibex_developers_manual/wiki/TestSerialPort
