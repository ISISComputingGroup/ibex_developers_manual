#Malformed URL errors

It is possible for the project files in the CS Studio application to become out of sync with what you have on disk. In this circumstance when attempting to load OPIs you will receive a malformed URL error message.

To fix this you can complete the following steps:

1. Delete the project files from the project using the Navigation view on the right of the screen. Be sure you do NOT check `'Delete project contents from disk'`.
2. Right click in the Navigation view white space (same location the project files were deleted from) and select `Import...`.
3. From the Import view select `Existing Projects into Workspace` and click Next.
4. Browse to your resources directory and click Finish.

The project files will now be correctly loaded and it is recommended you restart CS Studio at this point to update the GUI menus.
