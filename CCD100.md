This device is used at ISIS to measure either pressure or flow.

There is a unit string set in the device by the team that set it up, they also set up any calibration that is needed (IBEX cannot control the calibration).

The CCD100 on POLARIS is at a particularly high baud rate and long cable run. This means that when the device is disconnected it receives junk. See https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/issues/2326.


# Models

There are 3 types of CCD100 in use at ISIS:

### MK1

We cannot talk to these remotely. They do not have a comms menu available via the front panel, and there will be no "func" button on the front panel. See ticket https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/issues/3819

**We can't talk to these units. Although there are ports and cables to physically connect the device to a moxa, there is no remote communication interface that we can use**

## MK2

These are "standard" models which have been in use on a few beamlines, notably polaris.

## MK3

These are "next generation" CCD100 models. We are not yet sure whether we can talk to these correctly. See ticket https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/issues/3821
