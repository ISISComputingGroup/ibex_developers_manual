This device is used at ISIS to measure either pressure or flow.

There is a unit string set in the device by the team that set it up, they also set up any calibration that is needed (IBEX cannot control the calibration).

The CCD100 on POLARIS is at a particularly high baud rate and long cable run. This means that when the device is disconnected it receives junk. See https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/issues/2326.


# Models

There are 3 types of CCD100 in use at ISIS:

### MK1

We cannot talk to these remotely. They do not have a comms menu available via the front panel, and there will be no "func" button on the front panel. See ticket https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/issues/3819

**We can't talk to these units. Although there are ports and cables to physically connect the device to a moxa, there is no remote communication interface that we can use**

## MK2

These are "standard" models which have been in use on a few beamlines, notably polaris.

## MK3

These are TCP based - if you are running ibex 11.0.0 or later you just need to set `IPADDR` (for tcp) instead of `PORT` (for serial) and it will automatically use a different protocol file appropriate for the Mk3. If you are not yet on this version of ibex, you may be able to hotfix it or see below for another approach.

These are "next generation" CCD100 models and are TCP based, see https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/issues/6440 Currently a working `devCCD100_mk3.proto` has been merged (same db file can be used), so to use the device you would need to
* copy `devCCD100_mk3.proto` to `devCCD100.proto`
* edit `st.cmd` to connect using tcp `drvAsynIPPortConfigure`  rather than `drvAsynSerialPOrtCOnfigure`

After merging of above work, you will be able to just set the `IPADDR` macro to IP address of unit (they do not support DHCP). Pressure section have been allocated a range of IP addresses to use for these devices, so we should not need to assign one. Check that the subnet mask on the unit has been changed to 255.255.**252**.0 and is not 255.255.255.0 (factory default). The units do respond to a ping when correctly connected to the network, however they either don't support (or it doesn't work) regarding gateways so they only ping from a machine on the the same subnet 

### MK3 troubleshooting
These devices lie about their IP address. A common example of this is one that says `130.246.039.156` on its front panel. in reality it's actually `130.246.39.156` - note the 0 has been removed from `039`. The device should probably have a `null` placeholder instead of using `0` as leading 0s are not valid in an IP address. 

They should respond to a ping, and even have a webpage which gives the current reading.
