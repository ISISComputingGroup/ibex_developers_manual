This device is used at ISIS to measure either pressure or flow.

There is a unit string set in the device by the team that set it up, they also set up any calibration that is needed (IBEX cannot control the calibration).

The CCD100 on POLARIS is at a particularly high baud rate and long cable run. This means that when the device is disconnected it receives junk. See https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/issues/2326.
