This page describes the work done as part of the documentation stand down on 2nd February 2018.

# Work in progress

## Create a spell checking utility for the wikis
- Developer: Adrian
- Reviewer: None
- Current status: In progress

As a developer, I would like the wiki to be spell checked so that I can be confident in the high quality of language use in the documentation.

I'm writing this as a general purpose unit test framework for the wikis so that we can add additional tests later on.

### Pages affected
- None directly

### Acceptance criteria
- Spell checker provides a test report for mis-spelled words in the wiki, along with their location
- There are no false positives reported by the spell checker. Common project specific words will be ignored
- The test can be run on individual files or the whole wiki
- The spell checker supports RST and markdown format (i.e. can be used on developer and user manual)
