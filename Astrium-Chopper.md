**Chopper 1 (NCS016)**

If the control program on the chopper PC is restarted for any reason, a reset will need to be performed before the chopper can be calibrated (which is also needed after a program restart).  This is done with a physical toggle switch on the monitoring system crate in the top of the lefthand cabinet.  (Fault LED 8 on the same card will be illuminated showing the error).

This cabinet is normally locked and so an instrument scientist will need to be contacted to gain access.
