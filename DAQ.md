# General

If a DAQ unit is power cycled, it may need to be reconnected from the National Instruments "MAX" (measurement and automation explorer) software. To do this, open MAX, expand "network devices", right click the relevant device, and use the "self-test" option, then try reconnecting from IBEX.
