# We should update component stewards

Yes, this was missed after the last retrospective. Some combination of James, Kathryn and John to do.

# Squish licenses

- We are happy with what we have for the budget we have
- Floating licenses/more licenses will cost more

# There are lots of tickets completed üëç There are lots of tickets also in ready üëé 

- Possible reasons:
   - Lots of support tickets (1/3rd of the sprint)
   - Lots of tickets leftover from EMU rush
- We are not extremely unhappy about this as we got a lot done, but it would be good to manage it better

Suggestion: To encourage throughput we prioritize reworks and reviews over current tickets as well as new tickets. 

- Pros
   - These reworks and reviews are likely a higher priority than our current ticket so it fits in with our prioritization
   - It should encourage tickets to not hang around in ready and review and decreases their time from ready t complete
   - May encourage people to document their progress more on a ticket when they are recording what they have done prior to switching to a rework
- Cons
   - More context switching
   - Switching state of a machine from one ticket to another takes time

Conclusion: This cannot be a blanket rule as there are many edge cases. For a sprint, we will try this. People should find a practical stopping point in their current ticket to do a rework if the situation arises. The metrics to decide on this will be: does everyone hate it? Has our throughput increased?

# Should we create support tickets for all work for all instruments (SECI and IBEX) whether in cycle or not and whether we're contacted individually or not

Yes, within reason.

- The documentation is useful for future issues to create context
- It should be recorded as support, otherwise, it seems we are pulling in tickets without the proper process
- Helps to capture our effort
- Support is defined as: if a scientist needs help
- SECI tickets should be recorded only if they are of relevance to IBEX
- If a support call took very little time e.g. writing the ticket would take more time it may not be worth it
   - It stops being time-effective or useful to others
- If a support call is one of a common theme we should record all them together as a tally to identify areas of the system we should improve

# We should demo more in sprint reviews

Yes, we need to take steps towards this.

- DEMO should be deployed to earlier to give people a chance to set up their demo
   - There is now a reminder for a few of us to remind the group we need to deploy at the start of the week so it is organised earlier
- We don't necessarily need to demo on DEMO it can be on our own machine
   - Though demoing on DEMO can be useful to point out issues surrounding performance, state that we did not experience on our own machine etc.
- It is a good chance for a dress rehearsal prior to scientist demos (we are a more forgiving audience)

# Should we try again with inviting scientists to sprint reviews? Relying on "proxy" product owners has failed multiple times recently

- We are happy with the current process of having separate scientist demos.
- Getting them to come is difficult and would extend reviews a lot.
- However, we should be more strict in demoing to scientists.
   - We should organise these as part of the release (added to the ticket template)

# Clean up after upgrade

Upgrade process was leaving a trail of mounted network disks. Upgrade scripts should clean up after themselves.

There is a ticket for this.

# Dashboard bug: This was an unnecessary own goal. Why did our testing (system, automated, manual) not catch these?

Reasons why it wasn't caught:
- Wouldn't have been seen unless we had neutrons 
- We haven't got 100% coverage
- The push for EMU made us rush
- Mistakes can be made
- Our simulation isn't very strong for pretending we have neutrons

Actions:
- We should be more aware to use TDD 
   - It is noted that it is difficult to know what to test on legacy code and that it is easy to spot a bug when you know what bug you're looking for
- If we demoed it may possibly have been caught, we should be more strict with demos

Positives:
- We were fast and reactive with our fix
- We are more aware of this now and know we should be more careful in testing and reviewing

# EMU: Switch back to SECI failed because of the presence of 32-bit Open Genie components. Is it likely to occur on other muon instruments? How should we avoid?

- This is now fixed
- There may be more banana skins
- As part of our migrations, we should test that we can go back and plan for a possible switch back
- This was tricky to catch
- We should have a set of standard things to test across similar instruments e.g. motors for refl and start/stop for every one
