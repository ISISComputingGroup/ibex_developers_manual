Summary of use is now in the [user manual](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/ibex_user_manual/wiki/Kepco-Power-Supply).

## Remote Command

Most of the KEPCOs at ISIS which are BOPs do not have the REM command to switch the Kepco to remote mode, only the more recent digital display ones, and possibly some of the dial display ones that were bought more recently (hence there being a manual labelled "firmware not in use")
