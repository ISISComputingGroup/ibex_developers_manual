This document should be read alongside the [front-end design document](Script-Server-Front-End-Design-Document).

## What it should do
* Accept multiple clients
* Serve up a list of available commands for the specified instrument over some protocol. The command should contain command parameters and a description, for example:
   * Name: set_ei
   * Parameters: incident energy (double)
   * Description: Positions the choppers to allow the specified incident energy through
* The commands are instrument specific scripts written by the instrument scientists and/or controls team, and are stored on the server
* New commands can be added relatively quickly without requiring changes to the client
* Accept and queue up jobs from clients and add them to the job queue
* Provide feedback on the status of the job queue
* Provide feedback on the status of the current job (% done, current line etc.)
* Iterate through the job queue
* Execute the jobs, one at a time from the queue
* Allow the job queue to be edited (e.g. reordered, jobs skipped or repeated)
* Allow the current job to be paused or aborted
* When a job is paused the next action is to resume it or abort it. It is not possible to run a different job then return to the paused job
* If the job is paused and the user manually changes the beamline then that change is keep when the job is resumed
* If a job is aborted it can be run again, but it will start from the beginning; however, it can be edited before being re-run
* Allow individual jobs to be edited (excluding the current job?)
* Provide a description of what existing jobs consist of (to allow editing) 
* Provide an estimate of how long a job will take
* Provide the elapsed time for the current job
* Run a black-box script as a job (see submitted scripts section below)
* Provide script validation, e.g. allow a dry run of a script or job
* Provide robust error handling and reporting

## Submitted scripts

Different types of script:

* Script server aware – created by a script generator
  * Loops unwound so each iteration is used to produce a job
  * Each job has tags for providing feedback, such as progress information, to the clients
* Script server aware – written by hand
  * Includes tags for the script server to provide extra functionality for the script server; such as “pause points” and progress information
* Black-box scripts – written by hand
  * Contains no information for the script server
  * Script server runs it as a single job but cannot pause it or report progress
  * Can be aborted

## Architectural design

Decisions already made:

* Scripts, commands and jobs will be written and run in CPython

A simple diagram of the design:

![Back End Design](design_documents/images/Script-Server-Back-End-Design-Document/Back_End_Design.png)

Commands:

* The instrument specific commands are loaded from a certain area on the NDX
* The command sources contain documentation describing the command and the parameters
* The list of commands and their information are served

Jobs:

* The Job Queue contains the jobs to be run
* The jobs are Python scripts/snippets
* The Job Manager is responsible for managing the queue and the running of the job
* For each job the Manager spawns a new* Python process to run the job
* If the job is configured correctly the Job Manager can query the status of the job

(*) This means there is no state shared between jobs – do we want this?
