## Overview
This page details how to write soft `motor` records that control two hard `motor` records with a `transform` record converting between the two coordinate systems in between. This is based on experiences writing the Larmor beamstop controller which has two Galil motor axes representing the angle of the arm (`theta`) and a horizontal (`w`) position which is controlled by two soft motors in a Cartesian coordinate system (`x`, `y`). This system is complicated by the fact that the `y` axis in Cartesian space is related to both the `w` and `theta` axes of the motors.

## Implementation
And example of two soft motors with a non-trivial coordinate transform in between taken from the Larmor beamstop is given below. In this example `$(MTR1)` and `$(MTR2)` are the real `motor` record (defined by the Galil IOC config) and `ARM:X` and `ARM:Y` are soft `motor` records.

```
record(motor, "$(P)ARM:X") 
{ 
    field(LOCK, "YES")
    field(DESC, "X axis position")
    field(SCAN, "Passive")
    field(DTYP, "Soft Channel") 
    field(OUT, "$(P)CONVERTXY.C PP MS") 
    field(RDBL, "$(P)CONVERTXY.F CP MS") 
    field(STOO, "$(P)ARM:MOTORS:STOP.A  PP MS") 
    field(DINP, "$(P)ARM:MOTORS:DMOV CP MS") 
    field(URIP, "Yes") 
    field(MRES,"0.001") 
    field(RRES,"1.000") 
    field(PREC,"3") 
    field(TWV,"5") 
    field(RTRY,"0") 
    field(EGU,"mm") 
}

record(motor,"$(P)ARM:Y") 
{ 
    field(LOCK, "YES")
    field(DESC, "Y axis position")
    field(SCAN, "Passive")
    field(DTYP,"Soft Channel") 
    field(OUT, "$(P)CONVERTXY.D PP MS") 
    field(RDBL,"$(P)CONVERTXY.G CP MS") 
    field(STOO,"$(P)ARM:MOTORS:STOP.B  PP MS") 
    field(DINP,"$(P)ARM:MOTORS:DMOV CP MS") 
    field(URIP, "Yes") 
    field(MRES,"0.001") 
    field(RRES,"1.000") 
    field(PREC,"3") 
    field(TWV,"5") 
    field(RTRY,"0") 
    field(EGU,"mm") 
}

record(transform, "$(P)CONVERTXY") {
	field(DESC, "Transform X then Y") 
    field(ASG, "READONLY")

    field(INPA, "$(P)$(MTR1) CP MS")
    field(INPB, "$(P)$(MTR2).DRBV CP MS")
    field(INPE, "$(ARMLEN)")

    field(CLCF, "COS(A)*E + B")
    field(CLCG, "SIN(A)*E")
    field(CLCH, "ASIN(D/E)")
    field(CLCI, "C - SQRT(E**2 - D**2)")

    field(OUTH, "$(P)$(MTR1) PP")
    field(OUTI, "$(P)$(MTR2).DVAL PP")
}
```
There are several fields that need to be considered. The most important fields in the soft `motor` records are the `OUT`, `RDBL`, `STOO`, and `DINP` fields.
 - The `RDBL` field reads the current position of the transformed motor positions from the `transform` record
 - The `OUT` field writes out the soft motor position to the `transform` record
 - The `STOO` field writes out a bit indicating if the user has requested the motors stop, this needs to be transformed to both the underlying motors.
 - The `DINP` field reads in a bit indicating if the underlying motors have stopped moving, this needs to read from both the underlying motors.

The former two fields can be linked directly to a single [`transform`](https://wiki-ext.aps.anl.gov/epics/index.php/RRM_3-14_Transform) record. A `transform` record can handle both the conversion to and from the soft motor's coordinate system. In the above example, the fields `CLCF` and `CLCG` transform the raw `motor` positions to the soft motor positions. `CLCH` and `CLCI` compute the inverse transform from soft motors to the underlying`motors.

For the latter two fields, two additional records are required if the axes of the soft motors are defined by a combination of the underlying motors. These should output a combination of the states from both underlying motors. For example:
```
record(transform, "$(P)ARM:MOTORS:STOP") {
    
    field(CLCC, "A || B")
    field(CLCD, "A || B")

    field(OUTC, "$(P)$(MTR1).STOP PP")
    field(OUTD, "$(P)$(MTR2).STOP PP")

    field(PINI, "YES")
}

record(calc, "$(P)ARM:MOTORS:DMOV") {
    field(SCAN, "Passive")
    field(INPA, "$(P)$(MTR1).DMOV CP")
    field(INPB, "$(P)$(MTR2).DMOV CP")

    field(CALC, "A && B")

    # Must include MDEL to avoid a race condition when setting
    # either of the soft motors to the position they're already at
    field(MDEL, "-1") 
    field(PINI, "YES")
}
```

## Testing using the IocTestFramework
The beamstop uses galil controllers for the underlying motors. Galils do not have an emulator in the IOC test framework. Instead galils have a simulation mode which can be turned on which can be used as a sort of pseudo-emulator. When experimenting with running a galil controller though the IOC test framework I found I needed to be careful of the following things:

 - That the flags enabling simulation mode have been turn on at some point during the galil startup. Specifically the following macros should be set:
```
  epicsEnvSet SIMULATE "1"
  epicsEnvSet IFSIM " "
  epicsEnvSet IFNOTSIM "#"
```
 - That the autosave feature of the galil device is turned off. If this is not disabled then it is possible for previous device state to interfere with the state of the tests. For example the limits from a previous galil run might be saved which may affect whether the test can successfully move to a given position.

 - That the device is run in dev sim mode, but without any lewis emulator. The example command for the beamstop in the `run_all_tests.bat` is:
```
call %PYTHON% "%EPICS_KIT_ROOT%\support\IocTestFramework\master\run_tests.py" -pf %MYPVPREFIX%  -d xybeamstop -p %EPICS_KIT_ROOT%\ioc\master\GALIL\iocBoot\iocGALIL-IOC-01
```
 
## Known issues
 - For the `DMOV` record the monitor deadband (`MDEL`) field needed to be defined as `-1` to avoid a race condition where the pulse from `1-0-1` would happen so fast that the soft motors would get stuck in the moving state forever. I also found I needed to set a delay on the motors (`DLY`) and a scan of about 1 second to prevent the soft motors missing the stop pulse from one or both motors.
