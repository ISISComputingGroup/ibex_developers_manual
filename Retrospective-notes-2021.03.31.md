# Retro

## From last last retro

- Monday reviews were working well until this week (mostly with cycle stresses)
- Doing well for using medium and low
- We haven't been putting system tickets in because the review column is long and we're trying to get everything in for cycle
- Release notes PR system we are happy with
- We haven't done games on Friday coffee for a couple of weeks
  - This may be work pressures but it would be good to make a bit of an effort to organise/join it

## Items from the last retro

- New planning site is getting easier
- Re-voting and the chair starting the discussion has helped to improve the discussion
- If a flash review needs release notes then it is not a flash review
- Big tickets aren't scary we should encourage people to pick them up when it is not possible to split them up

## How to manage security issues

- Could use the private git-repo or Microsoft teams board and link from Github
- There are lots of different types of security vulnerabilities and there is a current concern from the organisation about security
- The important thing is that we have enabled a conversation about it in planning

Action: Chris MS Will ask Anthony from FIT how they do it

## Ticket, PR and branch cleanup in long shutdown

- We should do this as we notice them
- We should also do a proper cleanup over the shutdown
- Most of the backlog is surprisingly valid
- Has been added to the long shutdown list

## What can we do to ease situations like the one we are currently in where we are short staffed (for very valid reasons), but when the urgent workload is high?

- Shall we do a 5-week sprint?
  - We have APRs, new starters, IBEX training, lots of stressful things coming up
  - Let's be careful what we add to the sprint
  - Still keep a bucket
  - We think 5-week sprint is better than 3 week
- Can we only point for 4 weeks of work and do Fridays if we're not doing support?
  - Concern is that we underestimate Friday tickets and overestimate their importance
  - Fridays are nice to have so may relieve stress
  - Or could do technical bookkeeping tickets e.g. the above-mentioned Ticket, PR and branch cleanup (we'll leave that choice up to the dev)
  - Fridays do help user experience improvement
- Yes we're going to do this
- Let's talk about this after the fact so we can organise the start of cycle sprints in a more solid way
- We like these ideas
- We can change the length of sprints to ensure releases are created in good time for the cycle
  - We can do a full release earlier on and a patch release later
  - In the long shutdown, we can do a few releases so we are ready
  - Can we get more of a manual release process into squish to reduce this

## Themed sprints

- Decide on one or two themes for a sprint
- Prioritise the theme in their own columns
- Have a couple of people dedicated to each theme with others helping them and others focusing more on support
- Needs management because we aren't fully sharing that information with the rest of the team
- People can take on different themes and lead each time so it is shared around
  - Ensure people have rotated around so we don't lose the ability to work on lots of different parts of the system
- Support can be set as a theme
- We should bear this in mind in planning
- Kathryn will upload document with idea of how to manage the project with themes and variable sprint lengths
