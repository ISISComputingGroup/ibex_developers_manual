# TPG36x

The TPG36x IOC controls a series a pressure gauges. The TPG36x device is *very* similar to the [TPG26x](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/ibex_developers_manual/wiki/TPG26x) device: the main difference is that the TPG36x uses different communication terminators, and uses RS485 as opposed to RS232.
