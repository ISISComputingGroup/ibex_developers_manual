This is a partially created device. It was created for the NURF experiment and ran on an ESS laptop. It needs USB driver software so probably will not be run directly from IBEX server.

# Notes

LOT.substitutions is generated by the IOC on startup, it reads the XML configuration of what is present and then creates it. The xml file location is set in st.cmd:

```
LOTConfigure("L0", "<file location>", "$(TOP)/db/LOT.substitutions", 0)
```

There is a test file in `data`.

IOC will not run without the device connected to the USB port.
