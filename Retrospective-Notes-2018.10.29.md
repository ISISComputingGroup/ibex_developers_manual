Generally slow sprint because of holidays. Please announce holidays to Kevin where possible so it can be planned in.

* Should we automatically measure how long tickets took?
    * No this is too hard but we should add comments to tickets which took too long or was overestimated. PM will pick this up at sprint end and make us a list to discuss.
* Changes over a certain size to be pair reviewed?
    * Yes for the moment create a label to indicate this
    * Look for a tool to measure complexity change (ticket being added)
* Access control on `INST:LIST`?
    * No fine for the moment, but change process for setting it to include a review before running.
* Review column > 10 items, ok?
    * Maybe because there were many tickets for release. Rory to monitor it for next time.
* Remove old Jenkins jobs?
    * Yes, Freddie to check that nothing is extra is captured in the old jobs and to back up then remove
* Remove E3 client and RCPTT?
    * John to check that it hasn't been run on any instrument and then create a ticket to delete jobs after backup of Jenkins and move it to client folder (instead of `client_E3`)
    * John to create RCPTT test transfer tickets
* Wiki checks should be smarter?
    * Yes, Liam to write a ticket
