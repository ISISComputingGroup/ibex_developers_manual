# We still didn't update component stewards

This keeps being missed.

# We should repoint tickets before planning

- Now added as step to https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/ibex_developers_manual/wiki/Sprint-Planning#preparation

# At least whilst WfH reterospective notes should be put in a dedicated teams channel

# In teams we can't use ticks/crosses easily for flash reviews

- Instead use shocked face emoji as looking, happy face as approved and sad as rejected. 
- Using a spreadsheet is too heavy so remove this

# Should we come up with a template for instrument demos?

Yes, the demo ticket should include this. We should make sure that more junior members of the team have sufficient input in to doing demos.

# Reviews have slowed since moving to WfH

- This could be due to people not being confident in how to review - we should make sure that PRs include instructions on how to review
- We could monitor who is owing reviews but this seems a little draconian, John will look into doing it.
