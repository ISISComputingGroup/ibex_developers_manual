# Introduction
The aim of the IOC Testing Framework is to allow the creation of automated tests for testing the behaviour of the IOCs. These tests are designed to be run on a nightly basis via Jenkins to provide some reassurance that there have been no breaking changes applied to the IOCs.

The testing is limited to a certain extent because we won't be testing the IOCs with the real hardware, but Lewis will provide a good approximation.
