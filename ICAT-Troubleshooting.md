**ICAT** is a metadata catalogue of ISIS (and other facilities' data).  **TopCAT** is the web interface to this catalogue.

For more information, see the [ICAT Project Website](https://icatproject.org/).

Occasionally, the process which ingests ISIS data into the ICAT catalogue stops and the main symptom of this is that new data isn't available via TopCAT.  This is what users notice and may call us about.

Unfortunately, the server that runs the ingestion process is managed by SCD and we have no control over it (although it is on the ISIS network).  There are various NAGIOS checks provided by SCD that we run on our server which notify the relevant people of any problems.

There is an ICAT/TopCAT entry in the dropdown box on the [error reporting page](http://sparrowhawk.nd.rl.ac.uk/footprints/) that can be used to submit a problem, or the SCD team can be contacted directly via their [email address](mailto:isisdata@stfc.ac.uk).
