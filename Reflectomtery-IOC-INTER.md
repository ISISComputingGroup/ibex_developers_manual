### Axes

The following were unused axes on August 2020:

- `SM Trans Y`
- `FOMS - Z2`
- `SM Angle2`
- `SM2 AngleEnc`
- `Long travel`
- `PD Distance`
- `PD2 Angle`

The `SM2 AngleEnc` is the axis which has the SM2 angle encoder connected to enable us to record the encoder and motor position separately.

They don't currently use the detector z axis so we don't need to have this in the reflectometry server
