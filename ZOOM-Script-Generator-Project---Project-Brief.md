The projectâ€™s goal is to develop a script generator for use by the Small Angle Neutron Scattering (SANS) Group. The scripts will be genie_python scripts that can run on the IBEX script server. Initially, the software will be needed for the ZOOM instrument (October 2016), but longer term will be used across all SANS instruments as they migrate to IBEX.
As well as meeting the requirements of the customers the software must integrate with the existing IBEX architecture. The project will be run in an Agile manner alongside the IBEX project.
Customer: The SANS Group will be represented by Sarah Rogers
Sponsor: Kevin Woods (Tessella)
