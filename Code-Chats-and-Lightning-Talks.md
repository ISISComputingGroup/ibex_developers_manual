# Code Chats

# Lightning Talks
Lightning talks are a chance to share smaller bits of interesting information after standup at the end of a sprint.
Topic | Presenter | Date
----- | --------- | ----
Rust | Jack Harper | 23/03/2022

All presentations should be uploaded to the SharePoint site [here](https://www.facilities.rl.ac.uk/isis/computing/ICPdiscussions/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=%2Fisis%2Fcomputing%2FICPdiscussions%2FGUI_Chat_Slides&FolderCTID=0x01200027AD8F05966A2748B3B04C98BB5B442B&View={F2C33C51-70E6-4343-B937-2C59A2568306}) (There is a subfolder for lightning talks) and/or converted to a wiki page if more appropriate. It should also be reasonably assumed that the people who gave these presentations should know something about these subjects.
