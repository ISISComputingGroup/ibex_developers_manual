A requirement of ticket [#4581](https://github.com/ISISComputingGroup/IBEX/issues/4581) was to inhibit motion of the front beam stop if the front detector was rotated more than 2 degrees in the positive or negative direction and to inhibit motion of the front detector rotation if the front beam stop rotation was more than 2 degrees in the positive or negative direction.

The implementation for this involves 4 records as a part of the motorExtensions support module. One for calculating if the detector rotation out of the range given in the requirement (this record processed on any change of the rotation setpoint and readback value), which then triggers processing of a dfanout record which sends a stop to the front beam stop rotation motor, sets DISP on the axis and the axis setpoint. Two further records are used in the same pattern for inhibiting the front detector rotation based on the fron beam stops rotation.

Setting the DISP means that dbPutFields to the axis and axis setpoint will now be ignored. We did not set DISP on the motor record itself as it presents a safety concern because the stop field would then ignore any puts to it, so we couldn't stop the motor in an emergency. We are aware that you will still be able to put to the actual motor record that sits beneath the axis, but are ok with this as the inhibiting record will actively notice any set points and send a stop to the motor, therefore you will not be able to actually move the motor.
